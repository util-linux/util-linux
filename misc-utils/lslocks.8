.SH OUTPUT
.IP "COMMAND"
The command name of the process holding the lock.
.IP "PID"
The process ID of the process which holds the lock.
.IP "TYPE"
The type of lock; can be FLOCK (created with \fBflock\fR(2)) or POSIX
(created with \fBfcntl\fR(2) and \fBlockf\fR(3)).
.IP "SIZE"
Size of the locked file.
.IP "MODE"
The lock's access permissions (read, write).  If the process is blocked and waiting for the lock,
then the mode is postfixed with an '*' (asterisk).
.IP "M"
Whether the lock is mandatory; 0 means no (meaning the lock is only advisory), 1 means yes.
(See \fBfcntl\fR(2).)
.IP "START"
Relative byte offset of the lock.
.IP "END"
Ending offset of the lock.
.IP "PATH"
Full path of the lock.  If none is found, or there are no permissions to read the path,
it will fall back to the device's mountpoint.  The path might be truncated; use
\fB\-\-notruncate\fR to get the full path.
.IP "BLOCKER"
The PID of the process which blocks the lock.
