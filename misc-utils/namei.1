.TH NAMEI 1 "June 2011" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
namei \- follow a pathname until a terminal point is found
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B namei
[options]
.IR pathname ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B namei
interprets its arguments as pathnames to any type
of Unix file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth).
.B namei
then follows each pathname until an endpoint
is found (a file, a directory, a device node, etc).
If it finds a symbolic link, it shows the link, and starts
following it, indenting the output to show the context.
.PP
This program is useful for finding "too many levels of
symbolic links" problems.
.PP
For each line of output,
.B namei
uses the following characters to identify the file type found:
.LP
.nf
   f: = the pathname currently being resolved
    d = directory
    l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents are output)
    s = socket
    b = block device
    c = character device
    p = FIFO (named pipe)
    - = regular file
    ? = an error of some kind
.fi
.PP
.B namei
prints an informative message when
the maximum number of symbolic links this system can have has been exceeded.
