.It Fl f Ar file 
Log the specified file.
.It Fl p Ar pri 
Enter the message with the specified priority.
The priority may be specified numerically or as a ``facility.level''
pair.
For example, ``\-p local3.info'' logs the message(s) as
.Ar info Ns rmational
level in the
.Ar local3
facility.
The default is ``user.notice.''
.It Fl t Ar tag 
Mark every line in the log with the specified
.Ar tag  .
.It Fl u Ar sock
Write to socket as specified with
.Ar socket
instead of builtin syslog routines.
.It Fl d

.It --
End the argument list. This is to allow the
.Ar message
to start with a hyphen (\-).
.It Ar message
Write the message to log; if not specified, and the
.Fl f
flag is not
provided, standard input is logged.
