.SH NAME
cal \- display a calendar
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cal
[options]
.RI [[[ day ] " month" ] " year" ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cal
displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are specified, the current
month is displayed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP

Display single month output.
(This is the default.)
.TP
\fB\-3\fR, \fB\-\-three\fR
Display three months spanning the date.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sunday\fR
Display Sunday as the first day of the week.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-monday\fR
Display Monday as the first day of the week.

Display a calendar for the whole year.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-week\fR[\fI=number\fR]
Display week numbers in the calendar (US or ISO-8601).
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR[\fI=when\fR]
Colorize output.  The
.I when
can be
.IR never ,
.IR auto ,
or
.IR always .
Never will turn off colorizing in all situations.  Auto is default, and
it will make colorizing to be in use if output is done to terminal.
Always will allow colors to be outputed when
.B cal
outputs to pipe, or is called from a script.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help text and exit.
.SH PARAMETERS
A single parameter specifies the year to be displayed; note the
year must be fully specified:
.B "cal 89"
will not display a calendar for 1989.
.PP
Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.
.PP
Three parameters denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be
highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal. If no parameters are
specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.
.PP
A year starts on Jan 1. The first day of the week is determined by the
locale.
.PP
The week numbering depends on the choice of the first day of the week.  If Sunday
(the default) is used for the first day of the week, then the customary North
American numbering will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year starts the
first week.  If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601 standard week numbering
is used, where the first Thursday of the year is in week number 1.
.SH COLORS
Implicit coloring can be disabled as follows:
.RS

.br
.BI "touch /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable"
.br

.RE
For more details see
.BR terminal-colors.d (5).
.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B cal
program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the date of the Gregorian calendar
reformation -- that is when it happened in Great Britain and its colonies
(including what is now the USA).  Ten days following that date were eliminated
by this reformation, so the calendar for that month is rather unusual.
The actual historical dates at which the calendar reform happened in all the
different countries (locales) are ignored.
.PP
Alternative calendars, such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar Hijri, the Ge'ez,
or the lunisolar Hindu, are not supported.
.SH HISTORY
A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
.SH AVAILABILITY
The cal command is part of the util-linux package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
