.SH NAME
wipefs \- wipe a signature from a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wipefs
.RB [ \-ahnpqtV ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR offset ]
.IR device ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wipefs
can erase filesystem, raid or partition-table signatures (magic strings) from
the specified
.I device
to make the signatures invisible for libblkid.

.B wipefs
does not erase the filesystem itself nor any other data from the device.
When used without any options, \fBwipefs\fR lists all visible filesystems
and the offsets of their basic signatures.

.B wipefs
calls the BLKRRPART ioctl when it has erased a partition-table signature
to inform the kernel about the change.

Note that some filesystems and some partition tables store more magic strings on
the device.  The
.B wipefs
command lists only the first offset where a magic string has been detected.  The device
is not scanned for additional magic strings for the same filesystem.  It is possible
that after a \fBwipefs -o \fIoffset\fR the same filesystem or partition
table will still be visible because of another magic string on another offset.

When option \fB-a\fR is used, all magic strings that are visible for libblkid are
erased.

Note that by default
.B wipefs
does not erase nested partition tables on non-whole disk devices.
For this the option \fB\-\-force\fR is required.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a , " \-\-all"
Erase all available signatures.  The set of erased signatures can be
restricted with the \fB\-t\fR option.
.TP
.BR \-b , " \-\-backup"
Create a signature backup to the file $HOME/wipefs-<devname>-<offset>.bak.
For more details see the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section.
.TP
.BR \-f , " \-\-force"
Force erasure, even if the filesystem is mounted.  This is required in
order to erase a partition-table signature on a block device.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.
.TP
.BR -n , " \-\-no\-act"
Causes everything to be done except for the write() call.
.TP
.BR \-o , " \-\-offset " \fIoffset\fP
Specify the location (in bytes) of the signature which should be erased from the
device.  The \fIoffset\fR number may include a "0x" prefix; then the number will be
interpreted as a hex value.  It is possible to specify multiple \fB-o\fR options.
.sp
The \fIoffset\fR argument may be followed by the multiplicative
suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB
(the "iB" is optional, e.g. "K" has the same meaning as "KiB"), or the suffixes
KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
.TP
.BR \-p , " \-\-parsable"
Print out in parsable instead of printable format.  Encode all potentially unsafe
characters of a string to the corresponding hex value prefixed by '\\x'.
.TP
.BR \-q , " \-\-quiet"
Suppress any messages after a successful signature wipe.
.TP
.BR \-t , " \-\-types " \fIlist\fP
Limit the set of printed or erased signatures.  More than one type may
be specified in a comma-separated list.  The list or individual types
can be prefixed with 'no' to specify the types on which no action should be
taken.  For more details see mount(8).
.TP
.BR -V , " \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.BR "wipefs --all --backup /dev/sdb"
Erases all signatures from the device /dev/sdb and creates a signature backup
file ~/wipefs-sdb-<offset>.bak for each signature.
.TP
.BR "dd if=~/wipefs-sdb-0x00000438.bak of=/dev/sdb seek=$((0x00000438)) bs=1 conv=notrunc"
Restores an ext2 signature from the backup file  ~/wipefs-sdb-0x00000438.bak.
