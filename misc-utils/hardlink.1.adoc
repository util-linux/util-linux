== NAME

hardlink - link multiple copies of a file

== SYNOPSIS

*hardlink* [options] [_directory_|_file_]...

== DESCRIPTION

*hardlink* is a tool which replaces copies of a file with hardlinks, therefore saving space.

== OPTIONS

*-h*, *--help*::
print quick usage details to the screen.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
More verbose output. If specified once, every hardlinked file is displayed, if specified twice, it also shows every comparison.

*-q*, *--quiet*::
Quiet mode, don't print anything.

*-n*, *--dry-run*::
Do not act, just print what would happen.

*-f*, *--respect-name*::
Only try to link files with the same (base)name. It's strongly recommended to use long options rather than *-f* which is interpreted in a different way by other *hardlink* implementations.

*-p*, *--ignore-mode*::
Link and compare files even if their mode is different. Results may be slightly unpredictable.

*-o*, *--ignore-owner*::
Link and compare files even if their owner information (user and group) differs. Results may be unpredictable.

*-t*, *--ignore-time*::
Link and compare files even if their time of modification is different. This is usually a good choice.

*-X*, *--respect-xattrs*::
Only try to link files with the same extended attributes.

*-m*, *--maximize*::
Among equal files, keep the file with the highest link count.

*-M*, *--minimize*::
Among equal files, keep the file with the lowest link count.

*-O*, *--keep-oldest*::
Among equal files, keep the oldest file (least recent modification time). By default, the newest file is kept. If *--maximize* or *--minimize* is specified, the link count has a higher precedence than the time of modification.

*-x*, *--exclude* _regex_::
A regular expression which excludes files from being compared and linked.

*-i*, *--include* _regex_::
A regular expression to include files. If the option *--exclude* has been given, this option re-includes files which would otherwise be excluded. If the option is used without *--exclude*, only files matched by the pattern are included.

*-s*, *--minimum-size* _size_::
The minimum size to consider. By default this is 1, so empty files will not be linked. The _size_ argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB").

*-b*, *--buffer-size* _size_::
The size of read buffer used when comparing file contents (default: 8KiB). This
costs some additional memory but potentially reduces the amount of seek
operations and therefore improve performance, especially with mechanic disk
drives. Optional factor suffixes are supported, like with the *-s* option. This is mostly efficient with other filters (i.e. with *-f* or *-X*) and can be less efficient with *-top* options.

== ARGUMENTS

*hardlink* takes one or more directories which will be searched for files to be linked.

== BUGS

The original *hardlink* implementation uses the option *-f* to force hardlinks creation between filesystem. This very rarely usable feature is no more supported by the current hardlink.

*hardlink* assumes that the trees it operates on do not change during operation. If a tree does change, the result is undefined and potentially dangerous. For example, if a regular file is replaced by a device, *hardlink* may start reading from the device. If a component of a path is replaced by a symbolic link or file permissions change, security may be compromised. Do not run *hardlink* on a changing tree or on a tree controlled by another user.

== AUTHOR

There are multiple *hardlink* implementations. The very first implementation is from Jakub Jelinek for Fedora distribution, this implementation has been used in util-linux between versions v2.34 to v2.36. The current implementations is based on Debian version from Julian Andres Klode.
