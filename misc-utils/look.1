.TH LOOK 1 "June 2011" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
look \- display lines beginning with a given string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B look
[options]
.IR "string " [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B look
utility displays any lines in
.I file
which contain
.IR string .
As
.B look
performs a binary search, the lines in
.I file
must be sorted (where
.BR sort (1)
was given the same options
.BR "\-d " and/or " \-f " that
.B look
is invoked with).
.PP
If
.I file
is not specified, the file
.I /usr/share/dict/words
is used, only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of
alphabetic characters is ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a , " \-\-alternative"
Use the alternative dictionary file.
.TP
.BR \-d , " \-\-alphanum"
Use normal dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumeric characters
are compared.  (This is on by default if no file is specified.)
.TP
.BR \-f , " \-\-ignore\-case"
Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.  (This is on by default if no file is
specified.)
.TP
.BR \-t , " \-\-terminate " \fIcharacter\fR
Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the characters
in \fIstring\fR up to and including the first occurrence of \fIcharacter\fR
are compared.
.TP
.BR \-V , " \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.
.PP
The
.B look
utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1 if
no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
.nf
sort -d /etc/passwd -o /tmp/look.dict
look -t: root:foobar /tmp/look.dict
.nf
.RE
.SH FILES
.IX Header "FILES"
.IP "\fB/usr/share/dict/words\fR" 4
the dictionary
.IP "\fB/usr/share/dict/web2\fR" 4
the alternative dictionary
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR grep (1),
.BR sort (1)
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters participated
in comparisons when the \fB\-\-alphanum\fR option was specified.  This was
incorrect, and the current man page matches the historic implementation.
.SH HISTORY
The
.B look
utility appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
.SH AVAILABILITY
The look command is part of the util-linux package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
