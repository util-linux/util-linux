all
---

 - use gettext() for column names on output in libsmartcols based tools and
   accept trantated as well as original names on command line (lsblk -o NAME,SIZE).
   https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/1291

tests
-----
  - add MacOS to GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/cibuild.yml). Note, we have used
    Mac in Travis-CI (see .travis.yml).

  - add Coverity to GitHub Actions (see for example .github/workflows/coverity.yml
    in systemd repo).

fstrim
------
  - "fstrim --fstab" uses root= from /proc/cmdline to get root FS when it's missing
    in fstab file. This is fragile (due to missing root= or the root FS is not
    accessible). The best seems to parse mountinfo and use mnt_table_get_root_fs()
    as a fallback solution.  https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/1266.

script (lib/pty-session.c)
--------------------------
  - (!) add #ifdefs and optional code for non-signalfd() systems

docs
----
  - use terminal hyperlinks (for example for --help)
    try on terminal: printf 'For more details see \e]8;;man:fdisk(8)\e\\fdisk(8)\e]8;;\e\\.\n'
    https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda

rev
---
  - support huge input lines (for example read input by small fixed buffer
    rather than try allocate all buffer for a whole line)
    see: https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/972

col
---
  - use unsigned sizes for columns and lines
  - check for limits to avoid segfaults
  - make it more robust
  https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/749

cal
---
   - support another --reforms, see for example freebsd version
     https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/usr.bin/ncal/ncal.c#L72

lscpu
-----
  - add "Boost/Turbo: true|false" based on /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo and
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost

  - add --freq output to visualise CPU use, see https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/1314

  - read cpuid and uname information from file if --sysroot is specified, then
    we can prepare regression tests completely independent on hw and architecture.

hwclock
------
 - use /var/lib/hwclock/drift to store hw-clock drift numbers.
 - use /etc/adjtime as read-only for UTC/LOCAL information only
 - the /var/lib/hwclock/drift should be implemented backwardly compatible,
   it means use the file only if exists, otherwise follow /etc/adjtime
 - see topic/hwclock-drift-file branch

bash completion
---------------
- Optional argument handling requires user to press backspace to get
  argument completion.
- Comma separated value, e.g., --output 'value1,value2', are not
  completed for users.

libmount (mount/umount)
-----------------------

 - mnt_context_get_excode() does not return error messages from /sbin/[u]mount.<type>
   external helpers. It is disadvantages in same cases (non-terminal programs).
   The solution is to use pipe(), keep output from helper in memory and return it later
   by mnt_context_get_excode() (or mnt_context_get_helper_output(), etc.). This feature
   should be optional and disabled by default.
   see: https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/1208

 - add --onlyonce to force mount(8) to check if mountpoint is already used. Now
   "already mounted" detection is used for --all only. The problem is if you
   call "mount <mountpoint>" more than once for in fstab defined tmpfs (or network
   filesystem etc.). In this case kernel does not return EBUSY, but a new instance
   of the FS is created. https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/448
   (... just idea, maybe wrong idea)

 - Extend mount(8) command line for mount flags modification without remount:
   "mount modify --clear noexec --set nodev,private,ro /mnt"
   This functionality should be implemented by mount_setattr() syscall.

partx
-----

 - support mapping by device-mapper if argv[0] is "kpartx" or --dm option is used.


getopt
------
  It would be great if getopt could optionally ignore unknown options.
  Currently, it outputs -- for every option it doesn't recognize but leaving the
  option as it is could beneficial wrapper scripts which could then pass the
  options they don't recognize as they are to the command they are wrapping.
  https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/701

docs
----

 - (!) use something better than gtk-doc for libmount and libblkid (doxygen?)

 - (!) add API documentation to libuuid

 - Improve line breaks in man pages and review markup


login-utils:
-----------

  - consolidate newgrp(1)
    * we have "su --group/--supp-group" to switch between groups, newgrp(1) in
      util-linux and shadow-utils (and sg(1) alias in shadow-utils)
    * the unique functionality provided by newgrp(1) is support for group
      passwords [/etc/gshadow] -- do we really need this functionality?
    * maybe we can mark group-passwords as deprecated, and replace sg(1) and
      newgrp(1) with su(1) code. The another way is to ask for group password in
      su --group too.
    * note that shadow-utils newgrp(1) provides support for syslog and audit log.


libsmartcols / column -t
------------------------
  - add column --table-header-color
  - add support for border of table
    * extend 'struct libscols_symbols', use box-drawing chars UTF8/ASCII
    * add scols_table_enable_border()


column(1):
  - add "--output-width unlimited" and no call cols_table_set_termwidth() and
    cols_table_set_termforce() in this case. See https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/1618


libblkid
--------

 - extend ZFS proper to scan for more uberblocks if BLKID_SUBLKS_MAGIC flag is set.
   This solution will make wipefs(8) more usable as ZFS is extremely variable with
   additional root blocks locations. See  https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/1228

 - (!) add support for BitLocker Drive Encryption
   https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/617
   https://github.com/libyal/libbde/blob/master/documentation/BitLocker%20Drive%20Encryption%20(BDE)%20format.asciidoc

 - (!) add support for dasd PT (used for example on s390)

libfdisk
--------

 - add support for Apple Partition Map (see libblkid/src/partitions/mac.c)
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Partition_Map

 - add support for nested PT (e.g. hybrid MBR) to scripts
   * add "nested-label:" block to sfdisk --dump
   * add "nested-partitiontable" to sfdisk --JSON
   * support nested labels parsing from dump
   see https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/850

misc
----

 - add mllockall() and SCHED_FIFO to hwclock,
   see http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/12/132


---------------
exotic requests
---------------

 - add SELinux security contexts support to the 'ipcs' utility
   http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=225342

   Would be great to list the current system IPC Objects with their respective
   security labels (where allowed) with something like 'ipcs -Z' - following the
   way other tools reports those.
