 Note that items with (!) have high priority.

lsblk
-----
  - currently it does not show mountpoint for all devices in btrfs RAID. It's because
    /proc/#/mountinfo contains reference to the one device only. Maybe we can add some
    btrfs specific code to provide a better output for FS based stacks. Not sure.
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1084453

cfdisk
------
  - (!) add auto-sort support (sort partitions automatically) and
    --sort={auto,never,always} command line option. This feature should be
    enabled by default for logical partitions if we created all container (extended
    partition) in the current session.
      

agetty
-----
  - support default issue (/etc/issue) output for agetty to make it agetty
    usable on systems with empty /etc. 

    This change is little bit controversial, because now agetty prints nothing 
    by default and it's probably used by admins to hide information about the 
    system to unauthorized users. We already have --noissue to disable issue 
    output. The question is if admins use this option, "rm /etc/issue" is 
    probably easer than modify inittab (or systemd unit file).

    Maybe we can implement it by --enable-agetty-default-issue compile option and 
    move the decision to downstream maintainers ;-)

nsenter(1)
----------
 - read the default UID and GID from the target process.
   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.utilities.util-linux-ng/9553/focus=9585

hwlock
------
 - use /var/lib/hwclock/drift to store hw-clock drift numbers.
 - use /etc/adjtime as read-only for UTC/LOCAL information only
 - the /var/lib/hwclock/drift should be implemented backwardly compatible,
   it means use the file only if exists, otherwise follow /etc/adjtime 

bash completion
---------------
- Optional argument handling requires user to press backspace to get
  argument completion.
- Comma separated value, e.g., --output 'value1,value2', are not
  completed for users.

libmount (mount/umount)
-----------------------

 - allow to execute mount(2) in another namespace, something like:
	mount --namespace=/proc/$n/ns/mnt  /dev/sda2 /bar
   see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1199554 for more details.

 - add options to control fstab/mtab mount options usage, something like:

   --options-mode={ignore,append,prepend,replace}      MNT_OMODE_{IGNORE, ...}
   --options-source={fstab,mtab,disable}               MNT_OMODE_{FSTAB,MTAB,NOTAB}
   --options-source-force                              MNT_OMODE_FORCE

   (all this already supported by libmount)


partx
-----

 - support mapping by device-mapper if argv[0] is "kpartx" or --dm option is used.
     

docs
----

 - (!) use something better than gtk-doc for libmount and libblkid (doxyden?)

 - (!) add API documentation to libuuid


login-utils:
-----------

  - consolidate newgrp(1)
    * we have "su --group/--supp-group" to switch between groups, newgrp(1) in
      util-linux and shadow-utils (and sg(1) alias in shadow-utils)
    * the unique functionality provided by newgpr(1) is support for group
      passwords [/etc/gshadow] -- do we really need this functionality?
    * maybe we can mark group-passwords as deprecated, and replace sg(1) and
      newgpr(1) with su(1) code. The another way is to ask fro group password in
      su --group too.
    * note that shadow-utils newgpr(1) provides support for syslog and audit log.

libblkid
--------

 - (!) don't use internally blkid_loff_t, rather use off_t, size_t, ssize_t,
       stdint.h types and so on...

 - add FSSIZE value  -- filesystem size (klibc requirement)

 - (!) add support for dasd PT (used for example on s390)

libfdisk
--------

 - add support for Apple Partition Map (see libblkid/src/partitions/mac.c)
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Partition_Map

 - catch SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and return to main menu.
   From Red Hat bugzilla #545488:

   While using fdisk normally, if you accidentally pressed the wrong button (to
   start a sequence of questions for some operation, e.g. 'c' to create
   partition).  The tool tries too hard to keep asking you for valid input.  You
   can't provide a blank or invalid input to get it to break out of the current
   dialog sequence and get back to the main menu.

misc
----

 - add mllockall() and SCHED_FIFO to hwclock,
   see http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/12/132
 

---------------
exotic requests
---------------

 - add SELinux security contexts support to the 'ipcs' utility
   http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=225342

   Would be great to list the current system IPC Objects with their respective
   security labels (where allowed) with something like 'ipcs -Z' - following the
   way other tools reports those.
