.TH TAILF 1 "July 2014" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
tailf \- follow the growth of a log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tailf
[option]
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tailf is deprecated.
It may have unfixed bugs and will be removed in March 2017. Nowadays it's safe
to use
.B tail -f
(coreutils) in contrast to the original documentation below.
.PP
.B tailf
will print out the last 10 lines of the given \fIfile\fR and then wait
for this \fIfile\fR to grow.  It is similar to
.B tail -f
but does not access the file when it is not growing.  This has the side
effect of not updating the access time for the file, so a filesystem flush
does not occur periodically when no log activity is happening.
.PP
.B tailf
is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a laptop when logging is
infrequent and the user desires that the hard disk spin down to conserve
battery life.
.TP
.BR \-n , " -\-lines=\fInumber\fR" , " \-\fInumber\fR"
Output the last
.I number
lines, instead of the last 10.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help
Display help text and exit.
