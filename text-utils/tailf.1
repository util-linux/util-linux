.TH TAILF 1 "July 2014" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
tailf \- follow the growth of a log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tailf
[option]
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tailf
will print out the last 10 lines of the given \fIfile\fR and then wait
for this \fIfile\fR to grow.  It is similar to
.B tail -f
but does not access the file when it is not growing.  This has the side
effect of not updating the access time for the file, so a filesystem flush
does not occur periodically when no log activity is happening.
.PP
.B tailf
is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a laptop when logging is
infrequent and the user desires that the hard disk spin down to conserve
battery life.
.TP
.BR \-n , " -\-lines=\fInumber\fR" , " \-\fInumber\fR"
Output the last
.I number
lines, instead of the last 10.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help
Display help text and exit.
