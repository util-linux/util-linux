.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pg
.RB [ \-\fInumber\fP ]
.RB [ \-p
.IR string ]
.RB [ \-cefnrs ]
.RB [ +\fIline\fP ]
.RB [ +/\fIpattern\fP/ ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pg
displays a text file on a
.SM CRT
one screenful at once.
After each page, a prompt is displayed.  The user may then either press the
newline key to view the next page or one of the keys described below.
.PP
If no filename is given on the command line,
.B pg
reads from standard input.
If standard output is not a terminal,
.B pg
acts like
.IR cat (1)
but precedes each file with its name if there is more than one.
.PP
If input comes from a pipe,
.B pg
stores the data in a buffer file while reading
to make navigation possible.
.SH OPTIONS
.B pg
accepts the following options:
.TP
.BI + number
Start at the given line.
.TP
.BI +/ pattern /
Start at the line containing the Basic Regular Expression
.I pattern
given.
.TP
.BI \- number
The number of lines per page.  Usually, this is the number of
.SM CRT
lines minus one.
.TP
.B \-c
Clear the screen before a page is displayed,
if the terminfo entry for the terminal provides this capability.
.TP
.B \-e

With this option,
.B pg
advances once a command letter is entered.
.TP
.BI \-p \ string
Instead of the normal prompt
.IR : ,
.I string
is displayed.
If
.I string
contains
.IR %d ,
its first occurrence is replaced by the number of the current page.
.TP

otherwise relative to the beginning.

.TP
.IB i l
Display the next or the indicated line.
.TP
.IB i f

.I i
must be a positive number and is always interpreted relative
to the current position.

must be a positive number.
.TP
\fIi\fR\fB?\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB?\fR or \fIi\fR\fB^\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB^\fR
