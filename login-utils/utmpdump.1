.TH UTMPDUMP "1" "July 2012" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
utmpdump \- dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR utmpdump " [options]"
.RI [ filename ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B utmpdump
is a simple program to dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw format, so they
can be examined.
.B utmpdump
reads from stdin unless a
.I filename
is passed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-follow\fP"
Output appended data as the file grows.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIfile\fR
Write command output to \fIfile\fR instead of standard output.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fP
Undump, write back edited login information into the utmp or wtmp files.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fP"
Display help text and exit.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fP"
Display version information and exit.
.SH NOTES
.B utmpdump
can be useful in cases of corrupted utmp or wtmp entries.  It can dump
out utmp/wtmp to an ASCII file, which can then be edited to remove
bogus entries, and reintegrated using:
.PP
.RS
.B utmpdump -r < ascii_file > wtmp
.RE
.PP
But be warned,
.B utmpdump
was written for debugging purposes only.
.SH BUGS
You may
.B not
use the
.B \-r
option, as the format for the utmp/wtmp files strongly depends on the input
format.  This tool was
.B not
written for normal use, but for debugging only.
