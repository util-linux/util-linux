.TH RUNUSER "1" "August 2012" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
runuser \- run a command with substitute user and group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B runuser
[options] -u
.IR user
.IR "command " [ argument ...]
.LP
.B runuser
[options] [-]
[
.IR "user " [ argument ...]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B runuser
allows to run commands with substitute user and group ID.
If the option \fB\-u\fR is not given, falls back to
.B su
compatible semantics and a shell is executed.
The difference between the commands
.B runuser
and
.B su
is that
.B runuser
does not ask for a password (because it may be executed by the root user only) and
it uses a different PAM configuration.
The command
.B runuser
does not have to be installed with suid permissions.
.PP
When called without arguments,
.B runuser
defaults to running an interactive shell as
.IR root .
.PP
For backward compatibility
.B runuser
defaults to not change the current directory and to only set the
environment variables
.B HOME
and
.B SHELL
(plus
.B USER
and
.B LOGNAME
if the target
.I user
is not root).
This version of
.B runuser
uses PAM for session management.
