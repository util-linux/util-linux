/*
 * Explanation of `adjusting' (Rob Hooft):
 *
 * The problem with my machine is that its CMOS clock is 10 seconds
 * per day slow. With this version of clock.c, and my '/etc/rc.local'
 * reading '/etc/clock -au' instead of '/etc/clock -u -s', this error
 * is automatically corrected at every boot.
 *
 * To do this job, the program reads and writes the file '/etc/adjtime'
 * to determine the correction, and to save its data. In this file are
 * three numbers:
 *
 *	1) the correction in seconds per day. (So if your clock runs 5
 *	   seconds per day fast, the first number should read -5.0)
 *	2) the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 the last time the program
 *	   was used
 *	3) the remaining part of a second which was leftover after the last
 *	   adjustment
 *
 * Installation and use of this program:
 *
 *	a) create a file '/etc/adjtime' containing as the first and only
 *	   line: '0.0 0 0.0'
 *	b) run 'clock -au' or 'clock -a', depending on whether your cmos is
 *	   in universal or local time. This updates the second number.
 *	c) set your system time using the 'date' command.
 *	d) update your cmos time using 'clock -wu' or 'clock -w'
 *	e) replace the first number in /etc/adjtime by your correction.
 *	f) put the command 'clock -au' or 'clock -a' in your '/etc/rc.local'

	 * effectively really sets it to 1:02:03.5, because it will update to
	 * 1:02:04 only half a second later.  Our caller passes the desired

	 * time that we will apply to the Hardware Clock, and start waiting

	 *
	 * For example, the caller requests that we set the Hardware Clock to
	 * 1:02:03, with reference time (current system time) = 6:07:08.250.
	 * We want the Hardware Clock to update to 1:02:04 at 6:07:09.250 on
	 * the system clock, and the first such update will occur 0.500
	 * seconds after we write to the Hardware Clock, so we spin until the
	 * system clock reads 6:07:08.750.  If we get there, great, but let's
	 * imagine the system is so heavily loaded that our process is
	 * preempted and by the time we get to run again, the system clock
	 * reads 6:07:11.990.  We now want to wait until the next xx:xx:xx.750
	 * time, which is 6:07:12.750 (4.5 seconds after the reference time),
	 * at which point we will set the Hardware Clock to 1:02:07 (4 seconds
	 * after the originally requested time).  If we do that successfully,
	 * then at 6:07:13.250 (5 seconds after the reference time), the

/*
 * History of this program:
 *
 * 98.08.12 BJH Version 2.4
 *
 * Don't use century byte from Hardware Clock. Add comments telling why.
 *
 * 98.06.20 BJH Version 2.3.
 *
 * Make --hctosys set the kernel timezone from TZ environment variable
 * and/or /usr/lib/zoneinfo. From Klaus Ripke (klaus@ripke.com).
 *
 * 98.03.05 BJH. Version 2.2.
 *
 * Add --getepoch and --setepoch.
 *
 * Fix some word length things so it works on Alpha.
 *
 * Make it work when /dev/rtc doesn't have the interrupt functions. In this
 * case, busywait for the top of a second instead of blocking and waiting
 * for the update complete interrupt.
 *
 * Fix a bunch of bugs too numerous to mention.
 *
 * 97.06.01: BJH. Version 2.1. Read and write the century byte (Byte 50) of
 * the ISA Hardware Clock when using direct ISA I/O. Problem discovered by
 * job (jei@iclnl.icl.nl).
 *
 * Use the rtc clock access method in preference to the KDGHWCLK method.
 * Problem discovered by Andreas Schwab <schwab@LS5.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.
 *
 * November 1996: Version 2.0.1. Modifications by Nicolai Langfeldt
 * (janl@math.uio.no) to make it compile on linux 1.2 machines as well as
 * more recent versions of the kernel. Introduced the NO_CLOCK access method
 * and wrote feature test code to detect absence of rtc headers.
 *
 ***************************************************************************
 * Maintenance notes
 *
 * To compile this, you must use GNU compiler optimization (-O option) in
 * order to make the "extern inline" functions from asm/io.h (inb(), etc.)
 * compile. If you don't optimize, which means the compiler will generate no
 * inline functions, the references to these functions in this program will
 * be compiled as external references. Since you probably won't be linking
 * with any functions by these names, you will have unresolved external
 * references when you link.
 *
 * Here's some info on how we must deal with the time that elapses while
 * this program runs: There are two major delays as we run:
 *
 *	1) Waiting up to 1 second for a transition of the Hardware Clock so
 *	   we are synchronized to the Hardware Clock.
 *	2) Running the "date" program to interpret the value of our --date
 *	   option.
 *
 * Reading the /etc/adjtime file is the next biggest source of delay and
 * uncertainty.
 *
 * The user wants to know what time it was at the moment he invoked us, not
 * some arbitrary time later. And in setting the clock, he is giving us the
 * time at the moment we are invoked, so if we set the clock some time
 * later, we have to add some time to that.
 *
 * So we check the system time as soon as we start up, then run "date" and
 * do file I/O if necessary, then wait to synchronize with a Hardware Clock
 * edge, then check the system time again to see how much time we spent. We
 * immediately read the clock then and (if appropriate) report that time,
 * and additionally, the delay we measured.
 *
 * If we're setting the clock to a time given by the user, we wait some more
 * so that the total delay is an integral number of seconds, then set the
 * Hardware Clock to the time the user requested plus that integral number
 * of seconds. N.B. The Hardware Clock can only be set in integral seconds.
 *
 * If we're setting the clock to the system clock value, we wait for the
 * system clock to reach the top of a second, and then set the Hardware
 * Clock to the system clock's value.
 *
 * Here's an interesting point about setting the Hardware Clock:  On my
 * machine, when you set it, it sets to that precise time. But one can
 * imagine another clock whose update oscillator marches on a steady one
 * second period, so updating the clock between any two oscillator ticks is
 * the same as updating it right at the earlier tick. To avoid any
 * complications that might cause, we set the clock as soon as possible
 * after an oscillator tick.
 *
 * About synchronizing to the Hardware Clock when reading the time: The
 * precision of the Hardware Clock counters themselves is one second. You
 * can't read the counters and find out that is 12:01:02.5. But if you
 * consider the location in time of the counter's ticks as part of its
 * value, then its precision is as infinite as time is continuous! What I'm
 * saying is this: To find out the _exact_ time in the hardware clock, we
 * wait until the next clock tick (the next time the second counter changes)
 * and measure how long we had to wait. We then read the value of the clock
 * counters and subtract the wait time and we know precisely what time it
 * was when we set out to query the time.
 *
 * hwclock uses this method, and considers the Hardware Clock to have
 * infinite precision.
