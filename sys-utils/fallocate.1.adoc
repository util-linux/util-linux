== NAME

fallocate - preallocate or deallocate space to a file

== SYNOPSIS

*fallocate* [*-c*|*-p*|*-z*|*-w*] [*-o* _offset_] *-l* _length_ [*-n*] _filename_

*fallocate* *-d* [*-o* _offset_] [*-l* _length_] _filename_

*fallocate* *-r* [*-o* _offset_] _filename_

*fallocate* *-x* [*-o* _offset_] *-l* _length filename_

== DESCRIPTION

*fallocate* is used to manipulate the allocated disk space for a file, either to deallocate or preallocate it. For filesystems which support the *fallocate*(2) system call, preallocation is done quickly by allocating blocks and marking them as uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data blocks. This is much faster than creating a file by filling it with zeroes.

The exit status returned by *fallocate* is 0 on success and 1 on failure.

== OPTIONS

The _length_ and _offset_ arguments may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB, and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, and YB.

The options *--collapse-range*, *--dig-holes*, *--report-holes*, *--punch-hole*, *--zero-range*, *--write-zeroes* and *--posix* are mutually exclusive.

*-c*, *--collapse-range*::
Removes a byte range from a file, without leaving a hole. The byte range to be collapsed starts at _offset_ and continues for _length_ bytes. At the completion of the operation, the contents of the file starting at the location __offset__+_length_ will be appended at the location _offset_, and the file will be _length_ bytes smaller. The option *--keep-size* may not be specified for the collapse-range operation.
+
Available since Linux 3.15 for ext4 (only for extent-based files) and XFS.
+
A filesystem may place limitations on the granularity of the operation, in order to ensure efficient implementation. Typically, _offset_ and _length_ must be a multiple of the filesystem logical block size, which varies according to the filesystem type and configuration. If a filesystem has such a requirement, the operation will fail with the error *EINVAL* if this requirement is violated.

*-d*, *--dig-holes*::
Detect and dig holes. This makes the file sparse in-place, without using extra disk space. The minimum size of the hole depends on filesystem I/O block size (usually 4096 bytes). Also, when using this option, *--keep-size* is implied. If no range is specified by *--offset* and *--length*, then the entire file is analyzed for holes.
+
You can think of this option as doing a "*cp --sparse*" and then renaming the destination file to the original, without the need for extra disk space.
+
See *--punch-hole* for a list of supported filesystems.

*-r*, *--report-holes*::
Scan the file and report the distribution of holes without modifying it.
Two kinds of holes are shown:
file holes – blocks that the filesystem has not allocated (reported by SEEK_HOLE);
data holes – ranges inside the file which are logically filled with zero bytes but still occupy disk space.
+
For each hole the offset, end and size in bytes are printed in verbose mode, followed by a summary that gives the total size and percentage of the file that each hole type represents by default.
If no offset is specified with *--offset*, the whole file is scanned.
+
This option is read-only and can be used on any file to estimate how much space could be reclaimed by *--dig-holes*.
+
See *--punch-hole* for a list of supported filesystems.

*-i*, *--insert-range*::
Insert a hole of _length_ bytes from _offset_, shifting existing data.

*-l*, *--length* _length_::
Specifies the length of the range, in bytes.

*-n*, *--keep-size*::
Do not modify the apparent length of the file. This may effectively allocate blocks past EOF, which can be removed with a truncate.

*-o*, *--offset* _offset_::
Specifies the beginning offset of the range, in bytes.

*-p*, *--punch-hole*::
Deallocates space (i.e., creates a hole) in the byte range starting at _offset_ and continuing for _length_ bytes. Within the specified range, partial filesystem blocks are zeroed, and whole filesystem blocks are removed from the file. After a successful call, subsequent reads from this range will return zeroes. This option may not be specified at the same time as the *--zero-range* option. Also, when using this option, *--keep-size* is implied.
+
Supported for XFS (since Linux 2.6.38), ext4 (since Linux 3.0), Btrfs (since Linux 3.7), tmpfs (since Linux 3.5) and gfs2 (since Linux 4.16).

*-v*, *--verbose*::
Enable verbose mode.

*-w*, *--write-zeroes*::
Zeroes space in the byte range starting at _offset_ and continuing for _length_ bytes. Within the specified range, written blocks are preallocated for the regions that span the holes in the file. After a successful call, subsequent reads from this range will return zeroes and subsequent writes to that range do not require further changes to the file mapping metadata.
+
Zeroing is done within the filesystem. The filesystem may use a hardware-accelerated zeroing command or may submit regular writes. The behavior depends on the filesystem design and the available hardware.
+
Option *--keep-size* cannot be specified for the write-zeroes operation because allocating written blocks beyond the inode size is not permitted.

*-x*, *--posix*::
Enable POSIX operation mode. In that mode allocation operation always completes, but it may take longer time when fast allocation is not supported by the underlying filesystem.

*-z*, *--zero-range*::
Zeroes space in the byte range starting at _offset_ and continuing for _length_ bytes. Within the specified range, blocks are preallocated for the regions that span the holes in the file. After a successful call, subsequent reads from this range will return zeroes.
+
Zeroing is done within the filesystem preferably by converting the range into unwritten extents. This approach means that the specified range will not be physically zeroed out on the device (except for partial blocks at either end of the range), and I/O is (otherwise) required only to update metadata.
+
Option *--keep-size* can be specified to prevent file length modification.
+
Available since Linux 3.14 for ext4 (only for extent-based files) and XFS.
