== NAME

wdctl - show hardware watchdog status

== SYNOPSIS

*wdctl* [options] [_device_...]

== DESCRIPTION

Show hardware watchdog status. The default device is _/dev/watchdog_. If more than one device is specified then the output is separated by one blank line.

If the device is already used or user has no permissions to read from the device, then *wdctl* reads data from sysfs. In this case information about supported features (flags) might be missing.

Note that the number of supported watchdog features is hardware specific.

== OPTIONS

*-f*, *--flags* _list_::
Print only the specified flags.

*-F*, *--noflags*::
Do not print information about flags.

*-I*, *--noident*::
Do not print watchdog identity information.

*-n*, *--noheadings*::
Do not print a header line for flags table.

*-o*, *--output* _list_::
Define the output columns to use in table of watchdog flags. If no output arrangement is specified, then a default set is used. Use *--help* to get list of all supported columns.

*-O*, *--oneline*::
Print all wanted information on one line in key="value" output format.

*-p*, *--setpretimeout* _seconds_::
Set the watchdog pre-timeout in seconds. A watchdog pre-timeout is a
notification generated by the watchdog before the watchdog reset might occur in
the event the watchdog has not been serviced. This notification is handled by
the kernel and can be configured to take an action using sysfs or by *--setpregovernor*.

*-g*, *--setpregovernor* _governor_::
Set pre-timeout governor name. For available governors see default **wdctl** output.

*-r*, *--raw*::
Use the raw output format.

*-s*, *--settimeout* _seconds_::
Set the watchdog timeout in seconds.

*-T*, *--notimeouts*::
Do not print watchdog timeouts.

*-x*, *--flags-only*::
Same as *-I -T*.
