 * i386 CMOS starts out with 14 bytes clock data alpha has something
 * similar, but with details depending on the machine type.
 *
 * byte 0: seconds		0-59
 * byte 2: minutes		0-59
 * byte 4: hours		0-23 in 24hr mode,
 *				1-12 in 12hr mode, with high bit unset/set
 *					if am/pm.
 * byte 6: weekday		1-7, Sunday=1
 * byte 7: day of the month	1-31
 * byte 8: month		1-12
 * byte 9: year			0-99
 *
 * Numbers are stored in BCD/binary if bit 2 of byte 11 is unset/set The
 * clock is in 12hr/24hr mode if bit 1 of byte 11 is unset/set The clock is
 * undefined (being updated) if bit 7 of byte 10 is set. The clock is frozen
 * (to be updated) by setting bit 7 of byte 11 Bit 7 of byte 14 indicates
 * whether the CMOS clock is reliable: it is 1 if RTC power has been good
 * since this bit was last read; it is 0 when the battery is dead and system
 * power has been off.
 *
 * Avoid setting the RTC clock within 2 seconds of the day rollover that
 * starts a new month or enters daylight saving time.
 *
 * The century situation is messy:
 *
 * Usually byte 50 (0x32) gives the century (in BCD, so 19 or 20 hex), but
 * IBM PS/2 has (part of) a checksum there and uses byte 55 (0x37).
 * Sometimes byte 127 (0x7f) or Bank 1, byte 0x48 gives the century. The
 * original RTC will not access any century byte; some modern versions will.
 * If a modern RTC or BIOS increments the century byte it may go from 0x19
 * to 0x20, but in some buggy cases 0x1a is produced.
