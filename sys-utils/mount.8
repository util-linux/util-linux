.I device dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big
tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at
.BR / .
These files can be spread out over several devices. The
.B mount
command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device
to the big file tree. Conversely, the
.BR umount (8)
command will detach it again.

The standard form of the
.B mount
command, is
.RS

.br
.BI "mount \-t" " type device dir"
.br

.RE
This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on
.I device
(which is of type
.IR type )
at the directory
.IR dir .
The previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of
.I dir
become invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted,
the pathname
.I dir
refers to the root of the filesystem on
.IR device .

If only directory or device is given, for example:
.RS

.br
.BI "mount /dir"
.br

.RE
then mount looks for a mountpoint and if not found then for a device in the
/etc/fstab file. It's possible to use
.B --target 
or
.B --source
options to avoid ambivalent interpretation of the given argument. For example
.RS

.br
.BI "mount --target /mountpoint"
.br

.RE


.B The listing and help.
.RS
The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility only.

For more robust and definable output use
.BR findmnt (8),
\fBespecially in your scripts\fP. Note that control characters in the
mountpoint name are replaced with '?'.

.TP
.BR "mount " [ -l "] [" "-t \fItype\fP" ]
lists all mounted filesystems (of type
.IR type ).
The option \-l adds the labels in this listing.
See below.
.RE

.B The device indication.
.RS
Most devices are indicated by a file name (of a block special device), like
.IR /dev/sda1 ,
but there are other possibilities. For example, in the case of an NFS mount,
.I device
may look like
.IR knuth.cwi.nl:/dir .
It is possible to indicate a block special device using its
filesystem
.B LABEL
or
.B UUID
(see the \-L and \-U options below) and
partition
.B PARTUUID
or
.B PARTLABEL
(partition identifiers are supported for example for GUID Partition Table (GPT)
partition tables).

Don't forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are really
unique, especially if you move, share or copy the device.  Use
.BR "lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID"
to verify that the UUIDs are really unique in your system.

The recommended setup is to use tags (e.g. LABEL=<label>) rather than
.B /dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,partuuid,partlabel}
udev symlinks in the /etc/fstab file. The tags are
more readable, robust and portable. The
.BR mount (8)
command internally uses udev
symlinks, so the use of symlinks in /etc/fstab has no advantage over the tags.
For more details see
.BR libblkid (3).

Note that
.BR mount (8)
uses UUIDs as strings. The UUIDs from command line or
.BR fstab (5)
are not converted to internal binary representation. The string representation
of the UUID should be based on lower case characters.

The
.I proc
filesystem is not associated with a special device, and when
mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as
.I proc
can be used instead of a device specification.
(The customary choice
.I none
is less fortunate: the error message `none busy' from
.B umount
can be confusing.)
.RE

.B The /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts files.
.RS
The file
.I /etc/fstab
(see
.BR fstab (5)),
may contain lines describing what devices are usually
mounted where, using which options. The default location of the
.BR fstab (5)
file could be overridden by --fstab <path> command line option (see below for
more details).
.LP
The command
.RS
.sp
.B mount \-a
.RB [ \-t
.IR type ]
.RB [ \-O
.IR optlist ]
.sp
.RE
(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned in
.I fstab
(of the proper type and/or having or not having the proper options)
to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose line contains the
.B noauto
keyword. Adding the
.B \-F
option will make mount fork, so that the
filesystems are mounted simultaneously.
.LP
When mounting a filesystem mentioned in
.IR fstab
or
.IR mtab,
it suffices to give only the device, or only the mount point.


The programs
.B mount
and
.B umount
maintain a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file
.IR /etc/mtab .
If no arguments are given to
.BR mount ,
this list is printed.

The
.B mount
program does not read the
.I /etc/fstab
file if
.I device
(or LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and
.I dir
are specified. For example:
.RS
.sp
.B "mount /dev/foo /dir"
.sp
.RE
If you want to override mount options from
.I /etc/fstab
you have to use:
.RS
.sp
.B "mount device|dir -o <options>"
.sp
.RE
and then the mount options from command line will be appended to
the list of options from
.IR /etc/fstab .
The usual behaviour is that the last option wins if there is more duplicated
options.

When the
.I proc
filesystem is mounted (say at
.IR /proc ),
the files
.I /etc/mtab
and
.I /proc/mounts
have very similar contents. The former has somewhat
more information, such as the mount options used,
but is not necessarily up-to-date (cf. the
.B \-n
option below). It is possible to replace
.I /etc/mtab
by a symbolic link to
.IR /proc/mounts ,
and especially when you have very large numbers of mounts
things will be much faster with that symlink,
but some information is lost that way, and in particular
using the "user" option will fail.
.RE

.B The non-superuser mounts.
.RS
Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems.
However, when
.I fstab
contains the
.B user
option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding system.
.LP
Thus, given a line
.RS
.sp
.B "/dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide"
.sp
.RE
any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on his CDROM
using the command
.RS
.sp
.B "mount /dev/cdrom"
.sp
.RE
or
.RS
.sp
.B "mount /cd"
.sp
.RE
For more details, see
.BR fstab (5).
Only the user that mounted a filesystem can unmount it again.
If any user should be able to unmount, then use
.B users
instead of
.B user
in the
.I fstab
line.
The
.B owner
option is similar to the
.B user
option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner
of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for
.I /dev/fd
if a login script makes the console user owner of this device.
The
.B group
option is similar, with the restriction that the user must be
member of the group of the special file.
.RE


.B The bind mounts.
.RS
.\" In fact since 2.3.99. At first the syntax was mount -t bind.
Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to remount part of the
file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is
.RS
.br
.B mount --bind
.I olddir newdir
.RE
or shortoption
.RS
.br
.B mount -B
.I olddir newdir
.RE
or fstab entry is:
.RS
.br
.I /olddir
.I /newdir
.B none bind
.RE

After this call the same contents is accessible in two places.
One can also remount a single file (on a single file). It's also
possible to use the bind mount to create a mountpoint from a regular
directory, for example:

.RS
.br
.B mount --bind
.I foo foo
.RE

The bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not possible
submounts. The entire file hierarchy including submounts is attached
a second place using

.RS
.br
.B mount --rbind
.I olddir newdir
.RE

or shortoption

.RS
.br
.B mount -R
.I olddir newdir
.RE
.\" available since Linux 2.4.11.

Note that the filesystem mount options will remain the same as those
on the original mount point, and cannot be changed by passing the -o
option along with --bind/--rbind. The mount options can be
changed by a separate remount command, for example:

.RS
.br
.B mount --bind
.I olddir newdir
.br
.B mount -o remount,ro
.I newdir
.RE

Note that behavior of the remount operation depends on the /etc/mtab file. The
first command stores the 'bind' flag to the /etc/mtab file and the second
command reads the flag from the file.  If you have a system without the
/etc/mtab file or if you explicitly define source and target for the remount
command (then mount(8) does not read /etc/mtab), then you have to use bind flag
(or option) for the remount command too. For example:

.RS
.br
.B mount --bind
.I olddir newdir
.br
.B mount -o remount,ro,bind
.I olddir newdir
.RE

Note that
.I remount,ro,bind
will create a read-only mountpoint (VFS entry), but the original filesystem suberblock
will be still writable, it means that the
.I olddir
will be writable, but the
.I newdir
will be read-only.
.RE

.B The move operation.
.RS
Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to atomically move a
.B mounted tree
to another place. The call is
.RS
.br
.B mount --move
.I olddir newdir
.RE
or shortoption
.RS
.br
.B mount -M
.I olddir newdir
.RE
This will cause the contents which previously appeared under olddir to be
accessed under newdir.  The physical location of the files is not changed.
Note that the
.I olddir
has to be a mountpoint.

Note that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is invalid and
unsupported. Use
.B findmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION /dir
to see the current propagation flags.
.RE

.B The shared subtrees operations.
.RS
Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its submounts as shared,
private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount provides ability to create mirrors
of that mount such that mounts and umounts within any of the mirrors propagate
to the other mirror. A slave mount receives propagation from its master, but
any not vice-versa.  A private mount carries no propagation abilities.  An
unbindable mount is a private mount which cannot be cloned through a bind
operation. Detailed semantics is documented in
.B Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt
file in the kernel source tree.

Supported operations:
.RS
.nf
.BI "mount --make-shared " mountpoint
.BI "mount --make-slave " mountpoint
.BI "mount --make-private " mountpoint
.BI "mount --make-unbindable " mountpoint
.fi
.RE

The following commands allows one to recursively change the type of all the
mounts under a given mountpoint.

.RS
.nf
.BI "mount --make-rshared " mountpoint
.BI "mount --make-rslave " mountpoint
.BI "mount --make-rprivate " mountpoint
.BI "mount --make-runbindable " mountpoint
.fi
.RE

.BR mount (8)
.B does not read
.BR fstab (5)
when --make-* operation is requested. All necessary information has to be
specified on command line.

Note that Linux kernel does not allow to change more propagation flags by one
.BR mount (2)
syscall and the flags cannot be mixed with another mount options.

Since util-linux 2.23 mount command allows to use more propagation flags
together and with another mount operations. This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.
The propagation flags are applied by additional mount(2) syscalls
after previous successful mount operation. Note that this use case is not
atomic. The propagation flags is possible to specify in
.BR fstab (5)
as mount options
.RI ( private ,
.IR slave ,
.IR shared ,
.IR unbindable ,
.IR rprivate ,
.IR rslave ,
.IR rshared ,
.IR runbindable ).

For example
.RS
.nf
.BI "mount --make-private --make-unbindable /dev/sda1 /A"
.fi
.RE

is the same as
.RS
.nf
.BI "mount /dev/sda1 /A"
.BI "mount --make-private /A"
.BI "mount --make-unbindable /A"
.fi
.RE
.RE

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
The full set of mount options used by an invocation of
.B mount
is determined by first extracting the
mount options for the filesystem from the
.I fstab
table, then applying any options specified by the
.B \-o
argument, and finally applying a
.BR \-r " or " \-w
option, when present.

Command line options available for the
.B mount
command:
.IP "\fB\-V, \-\-version\fP"
Display version information and exit.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Display help text and exit.
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP"
Verbose mode.
.IP "\fB\-a, \-\-all\fP"
Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in
.IR fstab
(except for those whose line contains the
.B noauto
keyword).
.IP "\fB\-F, \-\-fork\fP"
(Used in conjunction with
.BR \-a .)
Fork off a new incarnation of mount for each device.
This will do the mounts on different devices or different NFS servers
in parallel.
This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts go in
parallel. A disadvantage is that the mounts are done in undefined order.
Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both
.I /usr
and
.IR /usr/spool .
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-fake\fP"
Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it's not
obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the filesystem.  This option is useful in
conjunction with the
.B \-v
flag to determine what the
.B mount
command is trying to do. It can also be used to add entries for devices
that were mounted earlier with the -n option. The -f option checks for
existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when the record already
exists (with regular non-fake mount, this check is done by kernel).
.IP "\fB\-i, \-\-internal\-only\fP"
Don't call the /sbin/mount.<filesystem> helper even if it exists.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-show\-labels\fP"
Add the labels in the mount output. Mount must have
permission to read the disk device (e.g. be suid root) for this to work.
One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using the
.BR e2label (8)
utility, or for XFS using
.BR xfs_admin (8),
or for reiserfs using
.BR reiserfstune (8).
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-no\-mtab\fP"
Mount without writing in
.IR /etc/mtab .
This is necessary for example when
.I /etc
is on a read-only filesystem.
.IP "\fB\-c, \-\-no\-canonicalize\fP"
Don't canonicalize paths. The mount command canonicalizes all paths 
(from command line or fstab) and stores canonicalized paths to the 
.IR /etc/mtab
file. This option can be used together with the
.B \-f
flag for already canonicalized absolute paths.
.IP "\fB\-s\fP"
Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will ignore mount
options not supported by a filesystem type. Not all filesystems support this
option. Currently it's supported by the mount.nfs mount helper only.
.IP "\fB\-\-source \fIsrc\fP"
If only one argument for the mount command is given then the argument might be
interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source (device). This option allows to
explicitly define that the argument is mount source.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-read\-only\fP"
Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is
.BR "\-o ro" .

Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel behavior, the
system may still write to the device. For example, ext3 or ext4 will replay its
journal if the filesystem is dirty. To prevent this kind of write access, you
may want to mount ext3 or ext4 filesystem with "ro,noload" mount options or
set the block device to read-only mode, see command
.BR blockdev (8).
.IP "\fB\-w, \-\-rw, \-\-read\-write\fP"
Mount the filesystem read/write. This is the default. A synonym is
.BR "\-o rw" .
.IP "\fB\-L, \-\-label \fIlabel\fP"
Mount the partition that has the specified
.IR label .
.IP "\fB\-U, \-\-uuid \fIuuid\fP"
Mount the partition that has the specified
.IR uuid .
These two options require the file
.I /proc/partitions
(present since Linux 2.1.116) to exist.
.IP "\fB\-T, \-\-fstab \fIpath\fP"
Specifies alternative fstab file. If the \fIpath\fP is directory then the files
in the directory are sorted by
.BR strverscmp (3),
files that starts with "." or without .fstab extension are ignored. The option
can be specified more than once. This option is mostly designed for initramfs
or chroot scripts where additional configuration is specified outside standard
system configuration.

Note that mount(8) does not pass the option \fB\-\-fstab\fP to
/sbin/mount.<type> helpers, it means that the alternative fstab files will be
invisible for the helpers. This is no problem for normal mounts, but user
(non-root) mounts always require fstab to verify user's rights.
.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-types \fIvfstype\fP"
The argument following the
.B \-t
is used to indicate the filesystem type.  The filesystem types which are
currently supported include:
.IR adfs ,
.IR affs ,
.IR autofs ,
.IR cifs ,
.IR coda ,
.IR coherent ,
.IR cramfs ,
.IR debugfs ,
.IR devpts ,
.IR efs ,
.IR ext ,
.IR ext2 ,
.IR ext3 ,
.IR ext4 ,
.IR hfs ,
.IR hfsplus ,
.IR hpfs ,
.IR iso9660 ,
.IR jfs ,
.IR minix ,
.IR msdos ,
.IR ncpfs ,
.IR nfs ,
.IR nfs4 ,
.IR ntfs ,
.IR proc ,
.IR qnx4 ,
.IR ramfs ,
.IR reiserfs ,
.IR romfs ,
.IR squashfs ,
.IR smbfs ,
.IR sysv ,
.IR tmpfs ,
.IR ubifs ,
.IR udf ,
.IR ufs ,
.IR umsdos ,
.IR usbfs ,
.IR vfat ,
.IR xenix ,
.IR xfs ,
.IR xiafs .
Note that coherent, sysv and xenix are equivalent and that
.I xenix
and
.I coherent
will be removed at some point in the future \(em use
.I sysv
instead. Since kernel version 2.1.21 the types
.I ext
and
.I xiafs
do not exist anymore. Earlier,
.I usbfs
was known as
.IR usbdevfs .
Note, the real list of all supported filesystems depends on your
kernel.

The programs
.B mount
and
.B umount
support filesystem subtypes.  The subtype is defined by '.subtype' suffix.  For
example  'fuse.sshfs'. It's recommended to use subtype notation rather than add
any prefix to the mount source (for example 'sshfs#example.com' is
deprecated).

For most types all the
.B mount
program has to do is issue a simple
.IR mount (2)
system call, and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem type is required.
For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) ad hoc code is
necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems
have a separate mount program. In order to make it possible to
treat all types in a uniform way, mount will execute the program
.BI /sbin/mount. TYPE
(if that exists) when called with type
.IR TYPE .
Since various versions of the
.B smbmount
program have different calling conventions,
.B /sbin/mount.smbfs
may have to be a shell script that sets up the desired call.

If no
.B \-t
option is given, or if the
.B auto
type is specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
Mount uses the blkid library for guessing the filesystem
type; if that does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
mount will try to read the file
.IR /etc/filesystems ,
or, if that does not exist,
.IR /proc/filesystems .
All of the filesystem types listed there will be tried,
except for those that are labeled "nodev" (e.g.,
.IR devpts ,
.I proc
and
.IR nfs ).
If
.I /etc/filesystems
ends in a line with a single * only, mount will read
.I /proc/filesystems
afterwards. All of the filesystem types will be
mounted with mount option "silent".

The
.B auto
type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.
Creating a file
.I /etc/filesystems
can be useful to change the probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos
or ext3 before ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.

More than one type may be specified in a comma separated
list.  The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.B no
to specify the filesystem types on which no action should be taken.
(This can be meaningful with the
.B \-a
option.) For example, the command:
.RS
.RS
.sp
.B "mount \-a \-t nomsdos,ext"
.sp
.RE
mounts all filesystems except those of type
.I msdos
and
.IR ext .
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-target \fIdir\fP"
If only one argument for the mount command is given then the argument might be
interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source (device). This option allows to
explicitly define that the argument is mount target.
.IP "\fB\-O, \-\-test-opts \fIopts\fP"
Used in conjunction with
.BR \-a ,
to limit the set of filesystems to which the
.B \-a
is applied.  Like
.B \-t
in this regard except that it is useless except in the context of
.BR \-a .
For example, the command:
.RS
.RS
.sp
.B "mount \-a \-O no_netdev"
.sp
.RE
mounts all filesystems except those which have the option
.I _netdev
specified in the options field in the
.I /etc/fstab
file.

It is different from
.B \-t
in that each option is matched exactly; a leading
.B no
at the beginning of one option does not negate the rest.

The
.B \-t
and
.B \-O
options are cumulative in effect; that is, the command
.RS
.sp
.B "mount \-a \-t ext2 \-O _netdev"
.sp
.RE
mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all filesystems
that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option specified.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-options \fIopts\fP"
Options are specified with a
.B \-o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options. For example:
.RS
.RS
.sp
.B "mount LABEL=mydisk \-o noatime,nouser"
.sp
.RE

For more details, see
.B FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS
and
.B FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS
sections.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-B, \-\-bind\fP"
Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are available
in both places). See above.
.IP "\fB\-R, \-\-rbind\fP"
Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else (so that its
contents are available in both places). See above.
.IP "\fB\-M, \-\-move\fP"
Move a subtree to some other place. See above.

.SH FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS
Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the
.I /etc/fstab
file.

Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default
in the system kernel. To check the current setting see the options
in /proc/mounts.

The following options apply to any filesystem that is being
mounted (but not every filesystem actually honors them - e.g., the
.B sync
option today has effect only for ext2, ext3, fat, vfat and ufs):

.TP
.B async
All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously. (See also the
.B sync
option.)
.TP
.B atime
Do not use noatime feature, then the inode access time is controlled by kernel
defaults. See also the description for
.B strictatime
and
.B relatime
mount options.
.TP
.B noatime
Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g., for faster
access on the news spool to speed up news servers).
.TP
.B auto
Can be mounted with the
.B \-a
option.
.TP
.B noauto
Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the
.B \-a
option will not cause the filesystem to be mounted).
.TP
\fBcontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP, \fBfscontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP, \fBdefcontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP and \fBrootcontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP
The
.BR context=
option is useful when mounting filesystems that do not support
extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard disk formatted with VFAT, or
systems that are not normally running under SELinux, such as an ext3 formatted
disk from a non-SELinux workstation. You can also use
.BR context=
on filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps in compatibility with
xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier 2.4.<x> kernel versions. Even where
xattrs are supported, you can save time not having to label every file by
assigning the entire disk one security context.

A commonly used option for removable media is
.BR context="system_u:object_r:removable_t" .

Two other options are
.BR fscontext=
and
.BR defcontext= ,
both of which are mutually exclusive of the context option. This means you
can use fscontext and defcontext with each other, but neither can be used with
context.

The
.BR fscontext=
option works for all filesystems, regardless of their xattr
support. The fscontext option sets the overarching filesystem label to a
specific security context. This filesystem label is separate from the
individual labels on the files. It represents the entire filesystem for
certain kinds of permission checks, such as during mount or file creation.
Individual file labels are still obtained from the xattrs on the files
themselves. The context option actually sets the aggregate context that
fscontext provides, in addition to supplying the same label for individual
files.

You can set the default security context for unlabeled files using
.BR defcontext=
option. This overrides the value set for unlabeled files in the policy and requires a
filesystem that supports xattr labeling.

The
.BR rootcontext=
option allows you to explicitly label the root inode of a FS being mounted
before that FS or inode becomes visible to userspace.  This was found to be
useful for things like stateless linux.

Note that the kernel rejects any remount request that includes the context
option, \fBeven\fP when unchanged from the current context.

.BR "Warning: the \fIcontext\fP value might contain commas" ,
in which case the value has to be properly quoted, otherwise
.BR mount (8)
will interpret the comma as a separator between mount options.  Don't forget that
the shell strips off quotes and thus
.BR "double quoting is required" .
For example:
.RS
.RS
.sp
.B mount -t tmpfs none /mnt \-o 'context="system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c127,c456",noexec'
.sp

.TP
.B defaults
Use default options:
.BR rw ", " suid ", " dev ", " exec ", " auto ", " nouser ", and " async.
.TP
.B dev
Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem.
.TP
.B nodev
Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file
system.
.TP
.B diratime
Update directory inode access times on this filesystem. This is the default.
.TP
.B nodiratime
Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.
.TP
.B dirsync
All directory updates within the filesystem should be done synchronously.
This affects the following system calls: creat, link, unlink, symlink,
mkdir, rmdir, mknod and rename.
.TP
.B exec
Permit execution of binaries.
.TP
.B noexec
Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem.
(Until recently it was possible to run binaries anyway using a command like
/lib/ld*.so /mnt/binary. This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 / 2.6.0.)
.TP
.B group
Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if one
of his groups matches the group of the device.
This option implies the options
.BR nosuid " and " nodev
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
.BR group,dev,suid ).
.TP
.B iversion
Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be incremented.
.TP
.B noiversion
Do not increment the i_version inode field.
.TP
.B mand
Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See
.BR fcntl (2).
.TP
.B nomand
Do not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.
.TP
.B _netdev
The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access
(used to prevent the system from attempting to mount these filesystems
until the network has been enabled on the system).
.TP
.B nofail
Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.
.TP
.B relatime
Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.  Access
time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the
current modify or change time. (Similar to noatime, but doesn't break
mutt or other applications that need to know if a file has been read
since the last time it was modified.)

Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by this
option (unless
.B noatime
was  specified), and the
.B strictatime
option is required to obtain traditional semantics. In addition, since Linux
2.6.30, the file's last access time is always  updated  if  it  is more than 1
day old.
.TP
.B norelatime
Do not use
.B relatime
feature. See also the
.B strictatime
mount option.
.TP
.B strictatime
Allows to explicitly requesting full atime updates. This makes it
possible for kernel to defaults to
.B relatime
or
.B noatime
but still allow userspace to override it. For more details about the default
system mount options see /proc/mounts.
.TP
.B nostrictatime
Use the kernel's default behaviour for inode access time updates.
.TP
.B suid
Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take
effect.
.TP
.B nosuid
Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take
effect.
.TP
.B silent
Turn on the silent flag.
.TP
.B loud
Turn off the silent flag.
.TP
.B owner
Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if he
is the owner of the device.
This option implies the options
.BR nosuid " and " nodev
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
.BR owner,dev,suid ).
.TP
.B remount
Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem.  This is commonly
used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make a
readonly filesystem writable. It does not change device or mount point.

The remount functionality follows the standard way how the mount command works
with options from fstab. It means the mount command doesn't read fstab (or
mtab) only when a
.IR device
and
.IR dir
are fully specified.

.BR "mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir"

After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary stuff from
fstab is ignored, except the loop= option which is internally generated and
maintained by the mount command.

.BR "mount -o remount,rw  /dir"

After this call mount reads fstab (or mtab) and merges these options with
options from command line (
.B -o
).
.TP
.B ro
Mount the filesystem read-only.
.TP
.B rw
Mount the filesystem read-write.
.TP
.B sync
All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously. In case of media with limited number of write cycles
(e.g. some flash drives) "sync" may cause life-cycle shortening.
.TP
.B user
Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.
The name of the mounting user is written to mtab so that he can unmount
the filesystem again.
This option implies the options
.BR noexec ", " nosuid ", and " nodev
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
.BR user,exec,dev,suid ).
.TP
.B nouser
Forbid an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem.
This is the default.
.TP
.B users
Allow every user to mount and unmount the filesystem.
This option implies the options
.BR noexec ", " nosuid ", and " nodev
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
.BR users,exec,dev,suid ).
.TP
.B x-*
All options prefixed with "x-" are interpreted as comments or userspace
applications specific options. These options are not stored to mtab file, send
to mount.<type> helpers or
.B mount(2)
system call. The suggested format is x-<appname>.<option> (e.g. x-systemd.automount).
.TP
.B x-mount.mkdir[=<mode>]
Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint). The optional argument <mode>
specifies the file system access mode used for
.B mkdir (2)
in octal notation. The default mode is 0755. This functionality is supported
only for root users.

.SH "FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS"
The following options apply only to certain filesystems.
We sort them by filesystem. They all follow the
.B \-o
flag.

What options are supported depends a bit on the running kernel.
More info may be found in the kernel source subdirectory
.IR Documentation/filesystems .

.SH "Mount options for adfs"
.TP
\fBuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP
Set the owner and group of the files in the filesystem (default: uid=gid=0).
.TP
\fBownmask=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBothmask=\fP\fIvalue\fP
Set the permission mask for ADFS 'owner' permissions and 'other' permissions,
respectively (default: 0700 and 0077, respectively).
See also
.IR /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/adfs.txt .
.SH "Mount options for affs"
.TP
\fBuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP
Set the owner and group of the root of the filesystem (default: uid=gid=0,
but with option
.B uid
or
.B gid
without specified value, the uid and gid of the current process are taken).
.TP
\fBsetuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBsetgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP
Set the owner and group of all files.
.TP
.BI mode= value
Set the mode of all files to
.IR value " & 0777"
disregarding the original permissions.
Add search permission to directories that have read permission.
The value is given in octal.
.TP
.B protect
Do not allow any changes to the protection bits on the filesystem.
.TP
.B usemp
Set uid and gid of the root of the filesystem to the uid and gid
of the mount point upon the first sync or umount, and then
clear this option. Strange...
.TP
.B verbose
Print an informational message for each successful mount.
.TP
.BI prefix= string
Prefix used before volume name, when following a link.
.TP
.BI volume= string
Prefix (of length at most 30) used before '/' when following a symbolic link.
.TP
.BI reserved= value
(Default: 2.) Number of unused blocks at the start of the device.
.TP
.BI root= value
Give explicitly the location of the root block.
.TP
.BI bs= value
Give blocksize. Allowed values are 512, 1024, 2048, 4096.
.TP
.BR grpquota | noquota | quota | usrquota
These options are accepted but ignored.
(However, quota utilities may react to such strings in
.IR /etc/fstab .)

.SH "Mount options for cifs"
See the options section of the
.BR mount.cifs (8)
man page (cifs-utils package must be installed).

.SH "Mount options for coherent"
None.

.SH "Mount options for debugfs"
The debugfs filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on
.IR /sys/kernel/debug .
.\" or just /debug
.\" present since 2.6.11
As of kernel version 3.4, debugfs has the following options:
.TP
.BI uid= n ", gid=" n
Set the owner and group of the mountpoint.
.TP
.BI mode= value
Sets the mode of the mountpoint.
.SH "Mount options for devpts"
The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on
.IR /dev/pts .
In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens
.IR /dev/ptmx ;
the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process
and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as
.IR /dev/pts/ <number>.
.TP
\fBuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP
This sets the owner or the group of newly created PTYs to
the specified values. When nothing is specified, they will
be set to the UID and GID of the creating process.
For example, if there is a tty group with GID 5, then
.B gid=5
will cause newly created PTYs to belong to the tty group.
.TP
.BI mode= value
Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the specified value.
The default is 0600.
A value of
.B mode=620
and
.B gid=5
makes "mesg y" the default on newly created PTYs.
.TP
\fBnewinstance
Create a private instance of devpts filesystem, such that
indices of ptys allocated in this new instance are
independent of indices created in other instances of devpts.

All mounts of devpts without this
.B newinstance
option share the same set of pty indices (i.e legacy mode).
Each mount of devpts with the
.B newinstance
option has a private set of pty indices.

This option is mainly used to support containers in the
linux kernel. It is implemented in linux kernel versions
starting with 2.6.29.  Further, this mount option is valid
only if CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the
kernel configuration.

To use this option effectively,
.IR /dev/ptmx
must be a symbolic link to
.IR pts/ptmx.
See
.IR Documentation/filesystems/devpts.txt
in the linux kernel source tree for details.
.TP
.BI ptmxmode= value

Set the mode for the new
.IR ptmx
device node in the devpts filesystem.

With the support for multiple instances of devpts (see
.B newinstance
option above), each instance has a private
.IR ptmx
node in the root of the devpts filesystem (typically
.IR /dev/pts/ptmx).

For compatibility with older versions of the kernel, the
default mode of the new
.IR ptmx
node is 0000.
.BI ptmxmode= value
specifies a more useful mode for the
.IR ptmx
node and is highly recommended when the
.B newinstance
option is specified.

This option is only implemented in linux kernel versions
starting with 2.6.29. Further this option is valid only if
CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the kernel
configuration.

.SH "Mount options for ext"
None.
Note that the `ext' filesystem is obsolete. Don't use it.
Since Linux version 2.1.21 extfs is no longer part of the kernel source.

.SH "Mount options for ext2"
The `ext2' filesystem is the standard Linux filesystem.
.\" Due to a kernel bug, it may be mounted with random mount options
.\" (fixed in Linux 2.0.4).
Since Linux 2.5.46, for most mount options the default
is determined by the filesystem superblock. Set them with
.BR tune2fs (8).
.TP
.BR acl | noacl
Support POSIX Access Control Lists (or not).
.\" requires CONFIG_EXT2_FS_POSIX_ACL
.TP
.BR bsddf | minixdf
Set the behaviour for the
.I statfs
system call. The
.B minixdf
behaviour is to return in the
.I f_blocks
field the total number of blocks of the filesystem, while the
.B bsddf
behaviour (which is the default) is to subtract the overhead blocks
used by the ext2 filesystem and not available for file storage. Thus
.sp 1
% mount /k -o minixdf; df /k; umount /k
.TS
tab(#);
l2 l2 r2 l2 l2 l
l c r c c l.

.TE
.sp 1
(Note that this example shows that one can add command line options
to the options given in
.IR /etc/fstab .)

.TP
.BR check=none " or " nocheck
No checking is done at mount time. This is the default. This is fast.
It is wise to invoke
.BR e2fsck (8)
every now and then, e.g. at boot time. The non-default behavior is unsupported
(check=normal and check=strict options have been removed). Note that these mount options
don't have to be supported if ext4 kernel driver is used for ext2 and ext3 filesystems.
.TP
.B debug
Print debugging info upon each (re)mount.
.TP
.BR errors= { continue | remount-ro | panic }
Define the behaviour when an error is encountered.
(Either ignore errors and just mark the filesystem erroneous and continue,
or remount the filesystem read-only, or panic and halt the system.)
The default is set in the filesystem superblock, and can be
changed using
.BR tune2fs (8).
.TP
.BR grpid | bsdgroups " and " nogrpid | sysvgroups
These options define what group id a newly created file gets.
When
.BR grpid
is set, it takes the group id of the directory in which it is created;
otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of the current process, unless
the directory has the setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid
from the parent directory, and also gets the setgid bit set
if it is a directory itself.
.TP
.BR grpquota | noquota | quota | usrquota
The usrquota (same as quota) mount option enables user quota support on the
filesystem. grpquota enables group quotas support. You need the quota utilities
to actually enable and manage the quota system.
.TP
.BR nouid32
Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for interoperability with older
kernels which only store and expect 16-bit values.
.TP
.BR oldalloc " or " orlov
Use old allocator or Orlov allocator for new inodes. Orlov is default.
.TP
\fBresgid=\fP\fIn\fP and \fBresuid=\fP\fIn\fP
The ext2 filesystem reserves a certain percentage of the available
space (by default 5%, see
.BR mke2fs (8)
and
.BR tune2fs (8)).
These options determine who can use the reserved blocks.
(Roughly: whoever has the specified uid, or belongs to the specified group.)
.TP
.BI sb= n
Instead of block 1, use block
.I n
as superblock. This could be useful when the filesystem has been damaged.
(Earlier, copies of the superblock would be made every 8192 blocks: in
block 1, 8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands of copies on
a big filesystem). Since version 1.08,
.B mke2fs
has a \-s (sparse superblock) option to reduce the number of backup
superblocks, and since version 1.15 this is the default. Note
that this may mean that ext2 filesystems created by a recent
.B mke2fs
cannot be mounted r/w under Linux 2.0.*.)
The block number here uses 1\ k units. Thus, if you want to use logical
block 32768 on a filesystem with 4\ k blocks, use "sb=131072".
.TP
.BR user_xattr | nouser_xattr
Support "user." extended attributes (or not).
.\" requires CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR


.SH "Mount options for ext3"
The ext3 filesystem is a version of the ext2 filesystem which has been
enhanced with journaling.  It supports the same options as ext2 as
well as the following additions:
.\" .TP
.\" .BR abort
.\" Mount the filesystem in abort mode, as if a fatal error has occurred.
.TP
.BR journal=update
Update the ext3 filesystem's journal to the current format.
.TP
.BR journal=inum
When a journal already exists, this option is ignored. Otherwise, it
specifies the number of the inode which will represent the ext3 filesystem's
journal file; ext3 will create a new journal, overwriting the old contents
of the file whose inode number is
.IR inum .
.TP
.BR journal_dev=devnum / journal_path=path
When the external journal device's major/minor numbers
have changed, these options allow the user to specify
the new journal location.  The journal device is
identified either through its new major/minor numbers encoded
in devnum, or via a path to the device.
.TP
.BR norecovery / noload
Don't load the journal on mounting.  Note that
if the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly,
skipping the journal replay will lead to the
filesystem containing inconsistencies that can
lead to any number of problems.
.TP
.BR data= { journal | ordered | writeback }
Specifies the journaling mode for file data.  Metadata is always journaled.
To use modes other than
.B ordered
on the root filesystem, pass the mode to the kernel as boot parameter, e.g.\&
.IR rootflags=data=journal .
.RS
.TP
.B journal
All data is committed into the journal prior to being written into the
main filesystem.
.TP
.B ordered
This is the default mode.  All data is forced directly out to the main file
system prior to its metadata being committed to the journal.
.TP
.B writeback
Data ordering is not preserved - data may be written into the main
filesystem after its metadata has been committed to the journal.
This is rumoured to be the highest-throughput option.  It guarantees
internal filesystem integrity, however it can allow old data to appear
in files after a crash and journal recovery.
.RE
.TP
.BR data_err=ignore
Just print an error message if an error occurs in a file data buffer in
ordered mode.
.TP
.BR data_err=abort
Abort the journal if an error occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode.
.TP
.BR barrier=0 " / " barrier=1 "
This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the jbd code.  barrier=0
disables, barrier=1 enables (default). This also requires an IO stack which can
support barriers, and if jbd gets an error on a barrier write, it will disable
barriers again with a warning.  Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering
of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some
performance penalty.  If your disks are battery-backed in one way or another,
disabling barriers may safely improve performance.
.TP
.BI commit= nrsec
Sync all data and metadata every
.I nrsec
seconds. The default value is 5 seconds. Zero means default.
.TP
.BR user_xattr
Enable Extended User Attributes. See the
.BR attr (5)
manual page.
.TP
.BR acl
Enable POSIX Access Control Lists. See the
.BR acl (5)
manual page.
.TP
.BR usrjquota=aquota.user | grpjquota=aquota.group | jqfmt=vfsv0
Apart from the old quota system (as in ext2, jqfmt=vfsold aka version 1 quota)
ext3 also supports journaled quotas (version 2 quota). jqfmt=vfsv0
enables journaled quotas. For journaled quotas the mount options
usrjquota=aquota.user and grpjquota=aquota.group are required to tell the
quota system which quota database files to use. Journaled quotas have the
advantage that even after a crash no quota check is required.

.SH "Mount options for ext4"
The ext4 filesystem is an advanced level of the ext3 filesystem which
incorporates scalability and reliability enhancements for supporting large
filesystem.

The options
.B journal_dev, norecovery, noload, data, commit, orlov, oldalloc, [no]user_xattr
.B [no]acl, bsddf, minixdf, debug, errors, data_err, grpid, bsdgroups, nogrpid
.B sysvgroups, resgid, resuid, sb, quota, noquota, grpquota, usrquota
.B usrjquota, grpjquota and jqfmt
are backwardly compatible with ext3 or ext2.
.TP
.BR journal_checksum
Enable checksumming of the journal transactions.  This will allow the recovery
code in e2fsck and the kernel to detect corruption in the kernel.  It is a
compatible change and will be ignored by older kernels.
.TP
.BR journal_async_commit
Commit block can be written to disk without waiting for descriptor blocks. If
enabled older kernels cannot mount the device.
This will enable 'journal_checksum' internally.
.TP
.BR barrier=0 " / " barrier=1 " / " barrier " / " nobarrier
These mount options have the same effect as in ext3.  The mount options
"barrier" and "nobarrier" are added for consistency with other ext4 mount
options.

The ext4 filesystem enables write barriers by default.
.TP
.BI inode_readahead_blks= n
This tuning parameter controls the maximum number of inode table blocks that
ext4's inode table readahead algorithm will pre-read into the buffer cache.
The value must be a power of 2. The default value is 32 blocks.
.TP
.BI stripe= n
Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will try to use for allocation size
and alignment. For RAID5/6 systems this should be the number of data disks *
RAID chunk size in filesystem blocks.
.TP
.BR delalloc
Deferring block allocation until write-out time.
.TP
.BR nodelalloc
Disable delayed allocation. Blocks are allocated when data is copied from user
to page cache.
.TP
.BI max_batch_time= usec
Maximum amount of time ext4 should wait for additional filesystem operations to
be batch together with a synchronous write operation. Since a synchronous
write operation is going to force a commit and then a wait for the I/O
complete, it doesn't cost much, and can be a huge throughput win, we wait for a
small amount of time to see if any other transactions can piggyback on the
synchronous write. The algorithm used is designed to automatically tune for
the speed of the disk, by measuring the amount of time (on average) that it
takes to finish committing a transaction. Call this time the "commit time".
If the time that the transaction has been running is less than the commit time,
ext4 will try sleeping for the commit time to see if other operations will join
the transaction. The commit time is capped by the max_batch_time, which
defaults to 15000\ \[mc]s (15\ ms). This optimization can be turned off entirely by
setting max_batch_time to 0.
.TP
.BI min_batch_time= usec
This parameter sets the commit time (as described above) to be at least
min_batch_time. It defaults to zero microseconds. Increasing this parameter
may improve the throughput of multi-threaded, synchronous workloads on very
fast disks, at the cost of increasing latency.
.TP
.BI journal_ioprio= prio
The I/O priority (from 0 to 7, where 0 is the highest priority) which should be
used for I/O operations submitted by kjournald2 during a commit operation.
This defaults to 3, which is a slightly higher priority than the default I/O
priority.
.TP
.BR abort
Simulate the effects of calling ext4_abort() for
debugging purposes.  This is normally used while
remounting a filesystem which is already mounted.
.TP
.BR auto_da_alloc | noauto_da_alloc
Many broken applications don't use fsync() when
replacing existing files via patterns such as

fd = open("foo.new")/write(fd,..)/close(fd)/ rename("foo.new", "foo")

or worse yet

fd = open("foo", O_TRUNC)/write(fd,..)/close(fd).

If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the replace-via-rename and
replace-via-truncate patterns and force that any delayed allocation blocks are
allocated such that at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered
mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk before the rename()
operation is committed.  This provides roughly the same level of guarantees as
ext3, and avoids the "zero-length" problem that can happen when a system
crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are forced to disk.
.TP
.BR noinit_itable
Do not initialize any uninitialized inode table blocks in the background. This
feature may be used by installation CD's so that the install process can
complete as quickly as possible; the inode table initialization process would
then be deferred until the next time the filesystem is mounted.
.TP
.BR init_itable=n
The lazy itable init code will wait n times the number of milliseconds it took
to zero out the previous block group's inode table. This minimizes the impact on
system performance while the filesystem's inode table is being initialized.
.TP
.BR discard / nodiscard
Controls whether ext4 should issue discard/TRIM commands to the underlying
block device when blocks are freed.  This is useful for SSD devices and
sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs, but it is off by default until sufficient
testing has been done.
.TP
.BR nouid32
Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for
interoperability  with  older kernels which only
store and expect 16-bit values.
.TP
.BR block_validity / noblock_validity
This options allows to enables/disables the in-kernel facility for tracking
filesystem metadata blocks within internal data structures. This allows multi-
block allocator and other routines to quickly locate extents which might
overlap with filesystem metadata blocks. This option is intended for debugging
purposes and since it negatively affects the performance, it is off by default.
.TP
.BR dioread_lock / dioread_nolock
Controls whether or not ext4 should use the DIO read locking. If the
dioread_nolock option is specified ext4 will allocate uninitialized extent
before buffer write and convert the extent to initialized after IO completes.
This approach allows ext4 code to avoid using inode mutex, which improves
scalability on high speed storages. However this does not work with data
journaling and dioread_nolock option will be ignored with kernel warning.
Note that dioread_nolock code path is only used for extent-based files.
Because of the restrictions this options comprises it is off by default
(e.g. dioread_lock).

.BR max_dir_size_kb=n
This limits the size of the directories so that any attempt to expand them
beyond the specified limit in kilobytes will cause an ENOSPC error. This is
useful in memory-constrained environments, where a very large directory can
cause severe performance problems or even provoke the Out Of Memory killer. (For
example, if there is only 512mb memory available, a 176mb directory may
seriously cramp the system's style.)

.SH "Mount options for iso9660"
ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be used
on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs. See also the
.I udf
filesystem.)

Normal
.I iso9660
filenames appear in a 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like restrictions on filename
length), and in addition all characters are in upper case.  Also there is
no field for file ownership, protection, number of links, provision for
block/character devices, etc.

Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these UNIX-like
features.  Basically there are extensions to each directory record that
supply all of the additional information, and when Rock Ridge is in use,
the filesystem is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX filesystem (except
that it is read-only, of course).
.TP
.B norock
Disable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if available. Cf.\&
.BR map .

.BR map .
.TP
.BR check= { r [ elaxed ]| s [ trict ]}
With

.BR check=strict .)
.TP
\fBuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP

.TP
.BR map= { n [ ormal ]| o [ ff ]| a [ corn ]}
For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps upper
to lower case ASCII, drops a trailing `;1', and converts `;' to `.'.
With
.B map=off
no name translation is done. See
.BR norock .
(Default:
.BR map=normal .)
.B map=acorn

Since Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs to specify the mode in
decimal. (Octal is indicated by a leading 0.)
.TP
.B unhide
Also show hidden and associated files.
(If the ordinary files and the associated or hidden files have
the same filenames, this may make the ordinary files inaccessible.)

.SH "Mount options for jfs"
.TP
.BI iocharset= name
Character set to use for converting from Unicode to ASCII.  The default is

.TP
.BI resize= value
Resize the volume to

.BR barrier=none " / " barrier=flush "
This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the journaling code.
barrier=none disables, barrier=flush enables (default). This also requires an
IO stack which can support barriers, and if reiserfs gets an error on a barrier
write, it will disable barriers again with a warning.  Write barriers enforce
proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches
safe to use, at some performance penalty.  If your disks are battery-backed in

The NodeList format is a comma-separated list of decimal numbers and ranges, a
range being two hyphen-separated decimal numbers, the smallest and largest node
numbers in the range.  For example, mpol=bind:0-3,5,7,9-15

Note that trying to mount a tmpfs with an mpol option will fail if the
running kernel does not support NUMA; and will fail if its nodelist
specifies a node which is not online.  If your system relies on that
tmpfs being mounted, but from time to time runs a kernel built without
NUMA capability (perhaps a safe recovery kernel), or with fewer nodes
online, then it is advisable to omit the mpol option from automatic
mount options.  It can be added later, when the tmpfs is already mounted
on MountPoint, by 'mount -o remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList MountPoint'.

.SH "Mount options for umsdos"
See mount options for msdos.
The
.B dotsOK
option is explicitly killed by
.IR umsdos .

.SH "Mount options for vfat"
First of all, the mount options for

are recognized.
The
.B dotsOK
option is explicitly killed by
.IR vfat .
Furthermore, there are
.TP
.B uni_xlate
Translate unhandled Unicode characters to special escaped sequences.
This lets you backup and restore filenames that are created with any
Unicode characters. Without this option, a '?' is used when no
translation is possible. The escape character is ':' because it is
otherwise illegal on the vfat filesystem. The escape sequence
that gets used, where u is the unicode character,
is: ':', (u & 0x3f), ((u>>6) & 0x3f), (u>>12).
.TP
.B posix
Allow two files with names that only differ in case.
This option is obsolete.
.TP
.B nonumtail
First try to make a short name without sequence number,
before trying
.IR name~num.ext .
.TP
.B utf8
UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of Unicode that is used by the
console. It can be enabled for the filesystem with this option or disabled
with utf8=0, utf8=no or utf8=false. If `uni_xlate' gets set, UTF8 gets
disabled.
.TP
.BR shortname= { lower | win95 | winnt | mixed }

Defines the behaviour for creation and display of filenames which fit into
8.3 characters. If a long name for a file exists, it will always be
preferred display. There are four modes:
:
.RS
.TP
.I lower
Force the short name to lower case upon display; store a long name when
the short name is not all upper case.
.TP
.I win95
Force the short name to upper case upon display; store a long name when
the short name is not all upper case.
.TP
.I winnt
Display the shortname as is; store a long name when the short name is
not all lower case or all upper case.
.TP
.I mixed
Display the short name as is; store a long name when the short name is not
all upper case. This mode is the default since Linux 2.6.32.

.SH "Mount options for usbfs"
.TP
\fBdevuid=\fP\fIuid\fP and \fBdevgid=\fP\fIgid\fP and \fBdevmode=\fP\fImode\fP
Set the owner and group and mode of the device files in the usbfs filesystem
(default: uid=gid=0, mode=0644). The mode is given in octal.
.TP
\fBbusuid=\fP\fIuid\fP and \fBbusgid=\fP\fIgid\fP and \fBbusmode=\fP\fImode\fP
Set the owner and group and mode of the bus directories in the usbfs
filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0555). The mode is given in octal.
.TP
\fBlistuid=\fP\fIuid\fP and \fBlistgid=\fP\fIgid\fP and \fBlistmode=\fP\fImode\fP
Set the owner and group and mode of the file

(default: uid=gid=0, mode=0444). The mode is given in octal.

.SH "Mount options for xenix"
None.

.SH "Mount options for xfs"
.TP
.BR allocsize=size
Sets the buffered I/O end-of-file preallocation size when
doing delayed allocation writeout. Valid values for this
option are page size (typically 4KiB) through to 1GiB,
inclusive, in power-of-2 increments.
.sp
The default behaviour is for dynamic end-of-file
preallocation size, which uses a set of heuristics to
optimise the preallocation size based on the current
allocation patterns within the file and the access patterns
to the file. Specifying a fixed allocsize value turns off
the dynamic behaviour.
.TP
.BR attr2 | noattr2
The options enable/disable an "opportunistic" improvement to
be made in the way inline extended attributes are stored
on-disk.  When the new form is used for the first time when
attr2 is selected (either when setting or removing extended
attributes) the on-disk superblock feature bit field will be
updated to reflect this format being in use.
.sp
The default behaviour is determined by the on-disk feature
bit indicating that attr2 behaviour is active. If either
mount option it set, then that becomes the new default used
by the filesystem.
.sp
CRC enabled filesystems always use the attr2 format, and so
will reject the noattr2 mount option if it is set.
.TP
.BR barrier | nobarrier
Enables/disables the use of block layer write barriers for
writes into the journal and for data integrity operations.
This allows for drive level write caching to be enabled, for
devices that support write barriers.
.TP
.BR discard | nodiscard
Enable/disable the issuing of commands to let the block
device reclaim space freed by the filesystem.  This is
useful for SSD devices, thinly provisioned LUNs and virtual
machine images, but may have a performance impact.
.sp
Note: It is currently recommended that you use the fstrim
application to discard unused blocks rather than the discard
mount option because the performance impact of this option
is quite severe.
.TP
.BR grpid | bsdgroups | nogrpid | sysvgroups
These options define what group ID a newly created file
gets.  When grpid is set, it takes the group ID of the
directory in which it is created; otherwise it takes the
fsgid of the current process, unless the directory has the
setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid from the
parent directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is
a directory itself.
.TP
.BR filestreams
Make the data allocator use the filestreams allocation mode
across the entire filesystem rather than just on directories
configured to use it.
.TP
.BR ikeep | noikeep
When ikeep is specified, XFS does not delete empty inode
clusters and keeps them around on disk.  When noikeep is
specified, empty inode clusters are returned to the free
space pool.
.TP
.BR inode32 | inode64
When inode32 is specified, it indicates that XFS limits
inode creation to locations which will not result in inode
numbers with more than 32 bits of significance.
.sp
When inode64 is specified, it indicates that XFS is allowed
to create inodes at any location in the filesystem,
including those which will result in inode numbers occupying
more than 32 bits of significance. 
.sp
inode32 is provided for backwards compatibility with older
systems and applications, since 64 bits inode numbers might
cause problems for some applications that cannot handle
large inode numbers.  If applications are in use which do
not handle inode numbers bigger than 32 bits, the inode32
option should be specified.
.TP
.BR  largeio | nolargeio
If "nolargeio" is specified, the optimal I/O reported in
st_blksize by stat(2) will be as small as possible to allow
user applications to avoid inefficient read/modify/write
I/O.  This is typically the page size of the machine, as
this is the granularity of the page cache.
.sp
If "largeio" specified, a filesystem that was created with a
"swidth" specified will return the "swidth" value (in bytes)
in st_blksize. If the filesystem does not have a "swidth"
specified but does specify an "allocsize" then "allocsize"
(in bytes) will be returned instead. Otherwise the behaviour
is the same as if "nolargeio" was specified.
.TP
.BR logbufs=value
Set the number of in-memory log buffers.  Valid numbers
range from 2-8 inclusive.
.sp
The default value is 8 buffers.
.sp
If the memory cost of 8 log buffers is too high on small
systems, then it may be reduced at some cost to performance
on metadata intensive workloads. The logbsize option below
controls the size of each buffer and so is also relevant to
this case.
.TP
.BR logbsize=value
Set the size of each in-memory log buffer.  The size may be
specified in bytes, or in kilobytes with a "k" suffix.
Valid sizes for version 1 and version 2 logs are 16384 (16\ k)
and 32768 (32\ k).  Valid sizes for version 2 logs also
include 65536 (64\ k), 131072 (128\ k) and 262144 (256\ k). The
logbsize must be an integer multiple of the log
stripe unit configured at mkfs time.
.sp
The default value for version 1 logs is 32768, while the
default value for version 2 logs is MAX(32768, log_sunit).
.TP
.BR logdev=device and rtdev=device
Use an external log (metadata journal) and/or real-time device.
An XFS filesystem has up to three parts: a data section, a log
section, and a real-time section.  The real-time section is
optional, and the log section can be separate from the data
section or contained within it.
.TP
.BR noalign
Data allocations will not be aligned at stripe unit
boundaries. This is only relevant to filesystems created
with non-zero data alignment parameters (sunit, swidth) by
mkfs.
.TP
.BR norecovery
The filesystem will be mounted without running log recovery.
If the filesystem was not cleanly unmounted, it is likely to
be inconsistent when mounted in "norecovery" mode.
Some files or directories may not be accessible because of this.
Filesystems mounted "norecovery" must be mounted read-only or
the mount will fail.
.TP
.BR nouuid
Don't check for double mounted file systems using the file
system uuid.  This is useful to mount LVM snapshot volumes,
and often used in combination with "norecovery" for mounting
read-only snapshots.
.TP
.BR noquota
Forcibly turns off all quota accounting and enforcement
within the filesystem.
.TP
.BR uquota/usrquota/uqnoenforce/quota
User disk quota accounting enabled, and limits (optionally)
enforced.  Refer to xfs_quota(8) for further details.
.TP
.BR gquota/grpquota/gqnoenforce
Group disk quota accounting enabled and limits (optionally)
enforced.  Refer to xfs_quota(8) for further details.
.TP
.BR pquota/prjquota/pqnoenforce
Project disk quota accounting enabled and limits (optionally)
enforced.  Refer to xfs_quota(8) for further details.
.TP
.BR sunit=value " and " swidth=value
Used to specify the stripe unit and width for a RAID device
or a stripe volume.  "value" must be specified in 512-byte
block units. These options are only relevant to filesystems
that were created with non-zero data alignment parameters.
.sp
The sunit and swidth parameters specified must be compatible
with the existing filesystem alignment characteristics.  In
general, that means the only valid changes to sunit are
increasing it by a power-of-2 multiple. Valid swidth values
are any integer multiple of a valid sunit value.
.sp
Typically the only time these mount options are necessary if
after an underlying RAID device has had it's geometry
modified, such as adding a new disk to a RAID5 lun and
reshaping it.
.TP
.BR swalloc
Data allocations will be rounded up to stripe width boundaries
when the current end of file is being extended and the file
size is larger than the stripe width size.
.TP
.BR wsync
When specified, all filesystem namespace operations are
executed synchronously. This ensures that when the namespace
operation (create, unlink, etc) completes, the change to the
namespace is on stable storage. This is useful in HA setups
where failover must not result in clients seeing
inconsistent namespace presentation during or after a
failover event.

.SH "Mount options for xiafs"
None. Although nothing is wrong with xiafs, it is not used much,
and is not maintained. Probably one shouldn't use it.
Since Linux version 2.1.21 xiafs is no longer part of the kernel source.

.SH "THE LOOP DEVICE"
One further possible type is a mount via the loop device. For example,
the command
.RS
.sp
.B "mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop"
.sp
.RE
will set up the loop device
.I /dev/loop3
to correspond to the file
.IR /tmp/disk.img ,
and then mount this device on
.IR /mnt .

If no explicit loop device is mentioned
(but just an option `\fB\-o loop\fP' is given), then
.B mount
will try to find some unused loop device and use that, for example
.RS
.sp
.B "mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o loop"
.sp
.RE
The mount command
.B automatically
creates a loop device from a regular file if a filesystem type is
not specified or the filesystem is known for libblkid, for example:
.RS
.sp
.B "mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt"
.sp
.B "mount -t ext3 /tmp/disk.img /mnt"
.sp
.RE
This type of mount knows about four options, namely
.BR loop ", " offset " and " sizelimit " ,
that are really options to
.BR \%losetup (8).
(These options can be used in addition to those specific
to the filesystem type.)

Since Linux 2.6.25 is supported auto-destruction of loop devices and
then any loop device allocated by
.B mount
will be freed by
.B umount
independently on
.IR /etc/mtab .

You can also free a loop device by hand, using `losetup -d' or `umount -d`.

.SH RETURN CODES
.B mount
has the following return codes (the bits can be ORed):
.TP
.BR 0
success
.TP
.BR 1
incorrect invocation or permissions
.TP
.BR 2

.TP
.BR 4

.TP
.BR 8

.TP
.BR 16

.BR 32

.TP
.BR 64
some mount succeeded
.RE

The command mount -a returns 0 (all success), 32 (all failed) or 64 (some
failed, some success).

.SH "EXTERNAL HELPERS"
The syntax of external mount helpers is:

.RS
.BI /sbin/mount. <suffix>
.I spec dir
.RB [ \-sfnv ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR options ]
.RB [ \-t
.IR type.subtype ]
.RE

where the <type> is filesystem type and \-sfnvo options have same meaning like
standard mount options. The \-t option is used  for filesystems with subtypes
support (for example /sbin/mount.fuse -t fuse.sshfs).

The command mount does not pass mount options
.BR unbindable ,
.BR runbindable ,
.BR private ,
.BR rprivate ,
.BR slave ,
.BR rslave ,
.BR shared ,
.BR rshared ,
.BR auto ,
.BR noauto ,
.BR comment ,
.BR x-*,
.BR loop ,
.BR offset
and
.BR sizelimit
to mount.<suffix> helpers. The all others options are
used in comma delimited list as argument for the option -o.

.SH BUGS
It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.
.PP
Some Linux filesystems don't support
.B "\-o sync and \-o dirsync"
(the ext2, ext3, fat and vfat filesystems
.I do
support synchronous updates (a la BSD) when mounted with the
.B sync
option).
.PP
The
.B "\-o remount"
may not be able to change mount parameters (all
.IR ext2fs -specific
parameters, except
.BR sb ,
are changeable with a remount, for example, but you can't change
.B gid
or
.B umask
for the
.IR fatfs ).
.PP
It is possible that files
.IR /etc/mtab
and
.IR /proc/mounts
don't match. The first file is based only on the mount command options, but the
content of the second file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g.\&
remote NFS server. In particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts file usually contains
more reliable information.)
.PP
Checking files on NFS filesystem referenced by file descriptors (i.e. the
.BR fcntl
and
.BR ioctl
families of functions) may lead to inconsistent result due to the lack of
consistency check in kernel even if noac is used.
.PP
The
.B loop
option with the
.B offset
or
.B sizelimit
options used may fail when using older kernels if the
.B mount
command can't confirm that the size of the block device has been configured
as requested. This situation can be worked around by using
the
.B losetup
command manually before calling
.B mount
with the configured loop device.

A
