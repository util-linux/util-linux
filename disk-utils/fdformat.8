.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fdformat
.RI [options] " device"
.SH DESCRIPTION

.I device
is usually one of the following (for floppy devices the major = 2, and the
minor is shown for informational purposes only):
.sp
.nf
.RS
/dev/fd0d360  (minor = 4)
/dev/fd0h1200 (minor = 8)
/dev/fd0D360  (minor = 12)
/dev/fd0H360  (minor = 12)
/dev/fd0D720  (minor = 16)
/dev/fd0H720  (minor = 16)
/dev/fd0h360  (minor = 20)
/dev/fd0h720  (minor = 24)
/dev/fd0H1440 (minor = 28)
.PP
/dev/fd1d360  (minor = 5)
/dev/fd1h1200 (minor = 9)
/dev/fd1D360  (minor = 13)
/dev/fd1H360  (minor = 13)
/dev/fd1D720  (minor = 17)
/dev/fd1H720  (minor = 17)
/dev/fd1h360  (minor = 21)
/dev/fd1h720  (minor = 25)
/dev/fd1H1440 (minor = 29)
.RE

.PP
The generic floppy devices, /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1, will fail to work with
.B fdformat
when a non-standard format is being used, or if the format has not been
autodetected earlier.  In this case, use
.BR setfdprm (8)
to load the disk parameters.
