.TH CFDISK 8 "March 2014" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
cfdisk \- display or manipulate a disk partition table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cfdisk
[options]
.RI [ device ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cfdisk
is a curses-based program for partitioning any block device.
The default device is
.BR /dev/sda .

Note that
.B cfdisk
provides basic partitioning functionality with a user-friendly interface.
If you need advanced features, use
.BR fdisk (8)
instead.

Since version 2.25
.B cfdisk
supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI disk labels, but no longer provides any
functionality for CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing.  CHS has
never been important for Linux, and this addressing concept does not make any
sense for new devices.

Since version 2.25
.B cfdisk
also does not provide a 'print' command any more.
This functionality is provided by the utilities
.BR partx (8)
and
.BR lsblk (8)
in a very comfortable and rich way.

If you want to remove an old partition table from a device, use
.BR wipefs (8).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.
.TP
.BR \-L , " \-\-color" [ = \fIwhen\fR]
Colorize the output; enabled by default.  The optional argument \fIwhen\fP can be
\fBauto\fR, \fBnever\fR or \fBalways\fR.  If the \fIwhen\fR argument is omitted,
it defaults to \fBauto\fR.
.TP
.BR \-V , " \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-z , " \-\-zero"
Start with an in-memory zeroed partition table.  This option does not zero the
partition table on the disk; rather, it simply starts the program without
reading the existing partition table.  This option allows to a create new
partition table from scratch or create a new partition table according to
a sfdisk compatible script.

.SH COMMANDS
The commands for
.B cfdisk
can be entered by pressing the corresponding key (pressing
.I Enter
after the command is not necessary).  Here is a list of the available
commands:
.TP
.B b
Toggle the bootable flag of the current partition.  This allows you to
select which primary partition is bootable on the drive.  This command may not
be available for all partition label types.
.TP
.B d
Delete the current partition.  This will convert the current partition
into free space and merge it with any free space immediately
surrounding the current partition.  A partition already marked as free
space or marked as unusable cannot be deleted.
.TP
.B h
Show the help screen.
.TP
.B n
Create a new partition from free space.
.B cfdisk
then prompts you for the size of the partition you want to create.
The default size is equal to the entire available free space at the current
position.

The size may be followed by a multiplicative suffix: KiB (=1024),
MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB
(the "iB" is optional, e.g. "K" has the same meaning as "KiB").
.TP
.B q
Quit the program.  This will exit the program without writing any data to
the disk.
.TP
.B u
Dump the current in-memory partition table to the sfdisk compatible file.
.sp
The script files are compatible between cfdisk, sfdisk, fdisk and another
libfdisk applications. For more details see
.BR sfdisk (8).
.sp
It is also possible to load sfdisk script to cfdisk if there is no partition
table on the device or when you start cfdisk with \fI--zero\fR command line
option.
.TP
.B t
Change the partition type.  By default, new partitions are created as
.I Linux
partitions.
.TP
.B W
Write the partition table to disk (you must enter an uppercase W).  Since
this might destroy data on the disk, you must either confirm or deny
the write by entering `yes' or `no'.  If you enter `yes',
.B cfdisk
will write the partition table to disk and then tell the kernel to re-read the
partition table from the disk.

The re-reading of the partition table does not always work.  In such a
case you need to inform the kernel about any new partitions by using
.BR partprobe (8)
or
.BR partx (8),
or by rebooting the system.
.TP
.IR "Up Arrow" , " Down Arrow"
Move the cursor to the previous or next partition.  If there are more
partitions than can be displayed on a screen, you can display the next
(previous) set of partitions by moving down (up) at the last (first)
partition displayed on the screen.

.PP
All commands can be entered with either uppercase or lowercase
letters (except for
.BR W rite).
When in a submenu or at a prompt for entering a size, you can hit the
.I ESC
key to return to the main menu.

.SH COLORS
Implicit coloring can be disabled by creating the empty file
.IR /etc/terminal-colors.d/cfdisk.disable .

See
.BR terminal-colors.d (5)
for more details about colorization configuration.

.B cfdisk
does not support color customization with a color-scheme file.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP LIBFDISK_DEBUG=all
enables libfdisk debug output.
.IP LIBBLKID_DEBUG=all
enables libblkid debug output.
.IP LIBSMARTCOLS_DEBUG=all
enables libsmartcols debug output.

from Kevin E. Martin (martin@cs.unc.edu).
