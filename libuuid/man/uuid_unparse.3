.TH UUID_UNPARSE 3 "May 2009" "util-linux" "Libuuid API"
.SH NAME
uuid_unparse \- convert an UUID from binary representation to a string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <uuid/uuid.h>
.sp
.BI "void uuid_unparse(uuid_t " uu ", char *" out );
.BI "void uuid_unparse_upper(uuid_t " uu ", char *" out );
.BI "void uuid_unparse_lower(uuid_t " uu ", char *" out );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B uuid_unparse
function converts the supplied UUID
.I uu
from the binary representation into a 36-byte string (plus tailing '\e0')
of the form 1b4e28ba\-2fa1\-11d2\-883f\-0016d3cca427 and stores this
value in the character string pointed to by
.IR out .
The case of the hex digits returned by
.B uuid_unparse
may be upper or lower case, and is
dependent on the system-dependent local default.
.PP
If the case of the
hex digits is important then the functions
.B uuid_unparse_upper
and
.B uuid_unparse_lower
may be used.
