.TH SCRIPTREPLAY 1 "September 2011" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH "NAME"
scriptreplay \- play back typescripts, using timing information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B scriptreplay
[options]
.RB [ \-t ]
.I timingfile
.RI [ typescript
.RI [ divisor ]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that
output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script
was recorded.
.PP
The replay simply displays the information again; the programs
that were run when the typescript was being recorded are \fBnot run again\fR.
Since the same information is simply being displayed,
.B scriptreplay
is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of
terminal the typescript was recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters
in the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to
which
.B scriptreplay
is sending its output.
.PP
The timing information is what
.BR script (1)
outputs to file specified by
.BR \-\-log-timing .
.PP
By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named
.BR typescript ,
but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or with option
.BR \-\-log\-out .
.PP
If the third parameter or
.BR \-\-divisor
is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier.
For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
.B scriptreplay
go twice as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower
than the original session.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-I , " \-\-log-in " \fIfile\fR
File containing \fBscript\fR's terminal input.
.TP
.BR \-O , " \-\-log-out " \fIfile\fR
File containing \fBscript\fR's terminal output.
.TP
.BR \-B , " \-\-log-io " \fIfile\fR
File containing \fBscript\fR's terminal output and input.
.TP
.BR \-t , " \-\-timing " \fIfile\fR
File containing \fBscript\fR's timing output.  This option overrides old-style arguments.
.TP
.BR \-T , " \-\-log\-timing " \fIfile\fR
aliast to \fB\-t\fR, maintained for compatibility with
.B script (1)
command line options.
.TP
.BR \-s , " \-\-typescript " \fIfile\fR
File containing \fBscript\fR's terminal output.  Deprecated alias to \fB\-\-log-out\fR.
This option overrides old-style arguments.
.TP
.BR \-c , " \-\-cr\-mode " \fImode\fR
Specifies how to use CR (0x0D, carriage return) character from log files.
The default mode is "auto", in this case CR is replaced with line break for
stdin log, because otherwise scriptreplay will overwrite the same line.
The another modes are "never" and "always".
.TP
.BR \-d , " \-\-divisor " \fInumber\fR
Speed up the replay displaying this
.I number
of times.  The argument is a floating point number.  It's called divisor
because it divides the timings by this factor.  This option overrides old-style arguments.
.TP
.BR \-m , " \-\-maxdelay " \fInumber\fR
Set the maximum delay between transcript updates to
.I number
of seconds.  The argument is a floating point number.  This can be used to
avoid long pauses in the transcript replay.
.TP
.BR " \-\-summary "
Display details about session recorded in the specified timing file and exit.  The session has 
to be recorded by "advanced" format (see
.B script (1)
option \fB\-\-logging\-format\fR for more details).
.TP
.BR \-x , " \-\-stream " \fItype\fR
Forces scriptreplay to print only specified stream.  The supported stream types
are 'in' or 'out'.  This option is recommended for multi-stream logs (e.g. --log-io)
to print only specified data.
.TP
.BR \-V , " \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.nf
% script --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
Script started, file is script.out
% ls
<etc, etc>
% exit
Script done, file is script.out
% scriptreplay --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
