== NAME

pam_lastlog2 - PAM module to display date of last login

== SYNOPSIS

*pam_lastlog2.so* [debug] [silent] [silent_if=<services>] [database=<file>]

== DESCRIPTION

pam_lastlog2 is a PAM module to display a line of information about the last login of the user. The module uses the /var/lib/lastlog/lastlog2.db database file to store all information.

Compared to pam_lastlog this PAM module is Y2038 safe and uses sqlite3 to store the information.

== OPTIONS

*debug*::
Print debug information.

*silent*::
Avoid all messages except errors and don't inform the user about any previous login, only update the /var/lib/lastlog/lastlog2.db database.

*silent_if=<services>*::
The argument *services* is a comma separated list of PAM services. If a service is listed here, the last login message will not be shown.

*database=<file>*::
Use *file* instead of /var/lib/lastlog/lastlog2.db.

== MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The *session* module type is provided for displaying the information about the last login and updating the lastlog file.

== RETURN VALUES

*PAM_SUCCESS*::
Everything was successful.

*PAM_SERVICE_ERR*::
Internal service module error. This includes error reading from or writing to the database.

*PAM_USER_UNKNOWN*::
User not known.

*PAM_IGNORE*::
Returned by service types which do nothing.

== EXAMPLES
Add the following line to e.g.  /etc/pam.d/login to display the last login time of a user:

session  optional pam_lastlog2.so silent_if=gdm,gdm-password

It is up to the administrator to decide if the user can login (optional/required) when
pam_lastlog2 has returned an error.
