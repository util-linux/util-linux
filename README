util-linux is a random collection of Linux utilities

The stuff in the subdirectories mount, fdisk, disk-utils, text-utils,
misc-utils, schedutils, sys-utils, getopt-* should be rather
distribution-neutral, and installing it does no harm.
On the other hand, the stuff in login-utils defines initial boot-time
stuff, things that are done in different ways by different distributions.
If you install it, your machine may not boot anymore, or you may be
unable to login.

No RPMs are provided - get yours from your distributor.
